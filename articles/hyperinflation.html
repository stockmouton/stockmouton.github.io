Ok, so what to look for?
- inflation rate
- 3y/10y/30y Treasury yields (the market pricing in expected inflation rate)
- Listen to the FED + FED target rate and open market operations
- Listen to the gov and tax cuts/debt
- signals of economic growth: unemployment level, GDP,
- population sentiment about inflation
- bubbles, casino behaviours (look at margin debt, )
- Value stocks/ growth stocks and subsequent ETF.
- money pairs
- Other parts of the worlds that compete with your country. For the US, China should be watched.

I would already secure myself against a crash

<h2 id="hyperinflation-and-market-dynamics-a-primer">HyperInflation and market dynamics: A primer</h2>
<p>Meh!</p>
<p>I’ve been lurking in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/options/">Reddit r/options</a> lately and I stumbled upon this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m4ffmx/long_commodities_short_bonds_protection_against/">post</a> predicting doomsday, hyperinflation, the crash of the bond market and subsequently, the stock market.</p>
<p>I don’t know if thoses hypotheses hold or not. But I saw an opportunity to fill some holes in my knowledge about what would trigger this doomsday crash. So, I decided to explore the subject and write a quick recap about this hyperinflation thing and why it matters.</p>
<p>It is in no way state-of-the-art thinking nor perfectly accurate. The devil always hides in the details and this is not the aim of this post. On top of that, it took me quite a while to research and write this piece os it might feel a little bit late to be published. Remember to do your own DD, apply what you learn, make your own prediction, observe what happens, learn from your mistakes and repeat!</p>
<p>Also, I’m quite new to the finance subject overall so take this post as a primer on market dynamics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this is not financial advices and only some educational material.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>Inflation rate (and expected inflation) will rise, Bonds yield will increase, bonds market will crash (hopefully in a kind of controlled manner), a massive amount of investment will rotate in other assets like stocks and crypto. Where though? Some good candidates are the company supported by the current government infrastructure plan. Some bad candidates are zombies companies, shady chinese stocks and SPACs far away from rentability. One might want to diversify with some crypto too (on a longer term maybe). Anyway, it’s not the time to YOLO as the market will probably be shaken overall and so, having a diversified portfolio and an eye on stock market to be able to react seems the best possible behaviours.</p>
<p>And to keep an eye on the market, just look at our <a href="../hyperinflation">hyperinflation dashboard</a></p>
<h2 id="a-quick-overview-of-the-game">A quick overview of the game</h2>
<p>Before diving into what is inflation and how it impacts investors, let’s look at the game itself.</p>
<p>We are playing the investment game. In this game, you have investors on one side and assets on the other. Investors try to make money by investing in those assets and assets try to attract investors money so they can grow.</p>
<p>This game is played all around the world, 24h/7: it’s a global economic competition and collaboration system.</p>
<h3 id="investors">investors</h3>
<p>Investors plan is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest money in assets</li>
<li>Wait</li>
<li>Profit (get back more money)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficult part is in “picking the right assets”. Investors have a nearly infinite amount of possible investments in this world: Housing, startup, stock, bonds, derivatives, art, crypto, NFTs, etc. you name it. And, access to all those investment around the world has never been so easy.</p>
<p>So, anyone can be an investor. All one needs is the will to follow the simple plan. The good news is that one can adapt any part of it to fit one’s own requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of the investment: from $0.01 to $1 Trillion.</li>
<li>The amount of time one wish to/must let money in the asset: from 1 millisecond to a century.</li>
<li>The amount of risk one wish/must take: from risk-free assets to lottery ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>To track its success the investor can measure (as a gross estimate) his return on investment (ROI):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Final value of the investment} - \text{Cost of the investment}}{\text{Cost of the investment}} \]</span></p>
<p>Once one decides how much one is willing to invest. From that pont it is good to consider a ROI goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>how much you want to make?</li>
<li>How long are you ready to wait?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="multiple-kinds-of-investors">Multiple kinds of investors</h4>
<p>Depending on those previous requirements and goal, investors exist in every kind. I won’t go into details but you might want to look how any of those behaves:</p>
<!-- - Institution TODO -->
<ul>
<li>Pension funds: invest a lot, wait a lot, lower risk to maximum. Needs to rebalance portfiolio regularly to minize the risk (Beware of end of quarter!)</li>
<li>Other Funds (mutual, etf, familly office, etc.): invest a lot, wait moderatly. Depending of their style they might be very risky or not. You must do your own work per fund to understands their behaviours</li>
<li>High frequency traders (market makers): Invest tiny amounts, very very fast, low risk. They are making money by helping the market more than by betting inside of it.</li>
<li>Retail traders: you, me, everyone trading from home. Invest very little comparing to other actors but are present in a much bigger number. So much that it definitely starts to make a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you want to look for with those different investors is their generic strategy and to which requirements they are bound by law/contracts. For example, pension funds have to keep a certain level of allocation or risks between bonds and stocks with only minor adjustment.</p>
<p>One concept that investors tend to follow is “investment rotation”. As the name suggest, it is when investors “rotate” some investment from one asset to some others. There are many reasons for that (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windowdressing.asp">window dressing</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp">portfolio rebalancing</a>) but as an example, we can look at the end of the first quarter of 2021: because bonds price were going down and stocks price were going up since the pandemic crash. It was expeced to see assets rotation from stocks to bonds at the end of march.</p>
<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>
<p>On the other side, assets try to attract investors money. This a prolific area with a lot of creativity, new kind of assets are created all the time: the need to satisfy any kind of investors spurs into reality any kind of assets, secure, risky, volatile, constant, expensive, cheap, complex, etc.</p>
<p>The way they attract investors is by making a promise. Mainly, a promise of a juicy ROI or low risk. Some assets are backed with strong fundamentals and financial mechanics (like bonds), sometimes it’s just a pure promise, no ties attached (like SPACs).</p>
<p>Their prices in the open market are driven by multiple forces among which is supply and demand but noy only. Another very important force is inflation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-inflation">What is inflation?</h2>
<p>Inflation (and deflation) are words that refer to the rate of change in the price of “things”. Understand “things” very broadly here: food, energy, house, stocks, bonds, ETF, etc. Anything that has a price.</p>
<p>To get the inflation rate of a thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>One look at the current price of it at a time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span>.</li>
<li>One wait some time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>.</li>
<li>One look again at those same prices <span class="math inline">\(p_{t + \Delta t}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Finally, you calculate the ratio as follow:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{inflation rate} = R_i = \frac{p_{t + \Delta t} - p_t}{p_t}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(R_i \lt 0\%\)</span>, we use the term deflation.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(R_i \gt 0\%\)</span> we use the term inflation.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(R_i \gt 50\%\)</span> we use the term hyperinflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: notice how it is similar to the investor simple plan and the ROI formula</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inflation rate can be measured for anything and people indeed measure the inflation of everything. Having a good way to measure inflation correctly is still a subject of heafty debate because it really depends on how one lives. But the one that is usually taken when people talk about inflation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index">Consumer price index (CPI)</a>.</p>
<p>People tend to focus on it because it is supposed to represent the cost of living for the urban lower and middle class. It contains a basket of goods one has to pay for when living in cities. If you live outside of cities, you want to look at one of its variation: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index">Personal Consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI)</a></p>
<p>An other interesting variation is the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL">core inflation rate</a>. It is the CPI (or the PCEPI) without food and energy which varies a lot (too volatile). For that reason, it is better to detect trends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: The CPI is an average of different prices, because of that and the fact that governements can change prices thanks to different tax policies makes people are wary that it is not a very good signal. It is usually considered a lagging signal in the sense that it is probably the last one reacting to inflation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CPI is only useful from the point of view of a consumer. This is why there exist an other one for the point of view of producer: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index">Producer Price Index(PPI)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ok-what-about-it">Ok, what about it?</h3>
<p>Inflation in itself is not a problem, it is actually good when it is happening at a moderate rate: as long as it fluctuates slowly with an obivous trend, the economy can adapt smoothly and its impact is not very important on the economy. Problems arise when quick change happens (like hyperinflation or hyper deflation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: Near-zero inflation or deflation is considered harmful for the economy because it is believed that they are signs of a worsening economy).</em></p>

<h3 id="what-creates-inflation-why-price-of-things-change-by-the-way">What creates inflation? Why price of things change by the way?</h3>
<p>Before going any further, it is really important to understand that <strong>nobody</strong> understand what creates inflation. We have yet to find a strong causal relationship for it, nainly because they are so much factors that impact something’s price.</p>
<p>To glance at it quickly, there 3 forces basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of borrowing: all the price one has to pay to borrow money (interest rates). It is usually needed for investment to start producing a thing (or scaling it).</li>
<li>Cost of production: all the cost one must pay to make thing real: labour wages, raw materials cost, etc.)</li>
<li>Cost of distribution: all the cost one must pay to bring the product to the people and make the people aware of it: delivery cost, marketing, communication, etc.)</li>
<li>Other costs like insurance etc.</li>
<li>Finally, supply and demand: how much people want that thing compared to how many one can produce of that thing. A good example are all apple products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Price changes because one of those factors is impacted. A sudden high demand would lead to what we call a demand-pool effect, increasing prices. A drop of supply would lead to the same outcome (called a cost-push). Tax cuts or hikes can raises or lowers cost of production and distribution. Insurance risk can increase, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, Inflation is a major force because it can increase all the cost at the same time. Even demand as people expect inflation to keep rising and would rather buy now than later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sidenote: I’m not talking about money supply as a cause for inflation on purpose. All studies on this belief debunk it. At most, money supply impact inflation on the long term but never in short term.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Inflation impacts directly investors because it lowers the value of money which impact what we call the “purchasing power”.</p>
<p>The purchasing power is the power to buy things: If $100 this year allows you to buy fewer things than $100 5 years ago, then you lost some purchasing power. It matters directly to everyone because it is the link betwen money and reality. And since the inflation rate measure how prices change, it becomes the direct measure of how much investors need to grow their amount of money to keep their purchasing power:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{ROI} &gt; \text{inflation rate} \]</span></p>
<p>This is why people tends to take inflation directly into account when computing returns or other measures. You can easily know when that happens because people add the word “real” before the measure. For example the “real ROI” is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{real ROI} = \text{ROI} - \text{inflation rate}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sidenote: The actual investors benefit per year must be computed by taking into account many other costs like taxes and the cost of living during that investment period</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="impact-on-the-open-market">Impact on the open market</h3>
<p>The real ROI is easily computable when we look at the past. But things start to be more complicated when we talk about the future. If we want to anticipate what will be our real ROI on a given period we now have two numbers to guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expected ROI</li>
<li>The expected inflation rate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: beware now, when you listen to any kind of forcasters, remember that the open market is considered to be <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/first-second-order-chaos/">a second-order chaotic system</a> and by definition is nearly unpredictable. And remember for yourself that one of the most pervasive and unavoidable bias of the human species is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> among other biased emotions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> and many others</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to add more objectivity in there, the scientific method is the way to go with tools like statistics. But for the future we are left with models that are usually inspired from the past and those are not hard science. So in general we are left with gut feelings, beliefs, reactive behaviours, and other non rational behaviours (this is also the main reaason why the market is not efficent).</p>
<p>As a second-order chaotic system, beliefs about the market impact it directly.Because beliefs tend to create expectations, and expectations when shared by enough people can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: If enough people want an asset to go up or down, it will indeed happen.</p>
<p>How is this all realted to inflation? Because expected inflation is a thing! In particular, it is a very powerful force in the bond market as yields are directly impacted by inflation and investors tend to invest for longer period of time in the bond market.</p>
<p>Before going on with those twisted feedback loops which influence the open market, we are going to dive into the basics of bonds and stocks. Again, we need to simplify greatly so we will leave out of the picture financial derivatives (FD) (options, futures, etc.) and focus on the USA.</p>
<p>Still, it is important to remember the assets in the US open market competes with other assets in other open market around the world.</p>

<h2 id="bonds-and-stocks">Bonds and Stocks</h2>
<p>Bonds and stocks represent two very different way to invest. Bonds are loans and stocks are pure investments. The main difference is that for bonds, you have a contract dictating how much return you will make when you buy it, and for stocks, you are mainly buying a promise that the company will grow and make more money.</p>
<h3 id="stocks">Stocks</h3>
<p>When you invest in stocks, you buy shares. It means you own a part of the company. The overall value of the company on the market (market cap) is represented by the sum of all those share price.</p>
<p>A second benefit of buying those shares is that if the company is profitable, an investor can receive money regularly (dividens). Supply/demands and exectation of the company’s performance are key forces that impact share prices. The more the company is attractive the more share price will increase.</p>

<h4 id="growth-stocks-value-stocks-and-other-kind-of-stocks">Growth stocks, value stocks and other kind of stocks</h4>
<p>Besides your belief individual investors tends to end up in two categories: value or growth investors. To keep it simple, one bets on what we call “growth stocks” which have a high potential but needs a lot of investment and loans(with bonds) to realize it. The other one bets on so-called “value stocks” which seeks the opposite undervalued profitable companies.</p>
<p>Both have a high potential, the first one is expected to grow very much and so its share price too. The other one is consideted undervalued and so should go through a positive correction of its share price in the future. For examples, Tesla is a growth stock and GME was a value stock (this case is interesting because it might transforms itself into a growth stocks!).</p>
<p>Outside of those two shiny category, you have many other kind of stocks in every industry: penny stocks (share price under 1$), zombie companies (companies which aren’t earning enough to cover their interest expenses), etc. All of them contains different risks and attract different kind of investors.</p>

<h3 id="bonds">Bonds</h3>
<p>When you invest in bonds, things are very different. First, bonds are not only issued from corporations but also municipals, states and governments. Second, a bond is issued with more properties than stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The face value: the original price at which the bond is issued</li>
<li>The coupon rate (interest rate): Annual percentage of the face value paid to the bondholder. Can be fixed or variable.</li>
<li>Maturity date: the date at which the amount of borrowed money (Called “the principal” = the face value) is given back to the bondholder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonds are interesting because they lower the risk of losing money. Let’s say one buys some bonds when they are issued:</p>
<ul>
<li>One pays the face value of the bonds to acquire them.</li>
<li>One then receives a fixed-income equal to the coupon annual payment every year.</li>
<li>One gets back its money at the maturity date.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the exact dynamic of a loan. When one lends money, one expects to be fully reimbursed by the end of the loan and receive a little extra in the meantime.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-after-bonds-are-issued">What happens after bonds are issued?</h4>
<p>After bonds are issued, they end up on the bond market where their price is subject to the usual market forces. Bonds are competing with eachother and more generally with other assets which means that their current price is not fixed and can fluctuate: this is why we give a different name to the price of the bond when it is issued (the face value).</p>
<p>Now, because all the properties of the bonds are fixed (face value, coupon’s rate and maturity date), but its price remains dynamic, it introduces a new notion: the yield.</p>
<p>The bond yield can be seen as its dynamic interest rate and is calculated relatively to its current price:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{bond yield} = \frac{\text{annual coupon payment}}{\text{current bond price}}\]</span></p>
<p>As a quick example, a bond with a face value of <span class="math inline">\(\text{\$1000}\)</span> with a fixed coupon’s rate of 5% per year leads to a total coupon annual payment of <span class="math inline">\(\text{\$50}\)</span>. if the price of the bonds decrease to <span class="math inline">\(\text{\$900}\)</span> the yield is now <span class="math inline">\(\frac{50}{900} = 0.55 = 55\%\)</span> which is higher than the original coupon’s rate and makes the bond more interesting. Not only one would buy that bond at lower price, but one would also receives a higher annual interest rate relative to its investment. Also, if one would keep it until maturity date, one would still receive the full face (which is still $1000).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: <em>By definition, the yield is inversely linked to the bond price: if the yield increase, the bond price decrease and vice-versa.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonds yields are a good measure for investors because you can compare it directly to the inflation rate or your expected inflation rate for the period of time you want to hold onto it. This means that the current inflation rate has a direct impact on bonds yield: Outside of any external intervention, supply and demands on bonds should move their price such that their yield satisify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{yield} &gt; \text{inflation rate} \Rightarrow \text{current price} &lt; \frac{\text{coupon&#39;s value}}{\text{inflation rate}}\]</span></p>
<p>So far so good. So what is the catch?</p>
<p>Bonds don’t provide a high yield comapred to other potential assets and they still suffer from 2 kinds of risk.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-perceive-bonds-risk">How to perceive bonds risk?</h4>
<p>The first risk is inflation. Since bonds are quite long term investment because of the low yield they provide. They are quite susceptible to expected inflation. As we’ve seen bonds yield will have to go up if inflation goes up because investors won’t hold on bonds that make them lose some purchasing powers.</p>
<p>This means that if you buy a bond and you plan to sell it, you better hope that the inflation rate will not increase. Because, first your real ROI will be lower and second, you will have to sell your bonds at a lower price. So investors spend some times trying to predict inflation rate to make sure they are buying bonds at a too high prices.</p>
<p>This is why a stabilized inflation rate is not dangerous to the open market. If it does not move, it does not impact bonds yield.</p>
<p>This inflation risk is especially important for long-term bonds (&gt;3 years until maturity date). Now for bonds that have their maturity date much closer, there is another risk: the borrower might not be able to return the principals on maturity date. We say that the bond default.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see a bond default before the maturity date because the coupon’s annual payment should not be very high for the borrower. At maturity on the other hand, the total principal is huge. And if the borrower as not used the money in a sufficiently smart way to be able to grow enough and make enough money, it might be in trouble to reimburse the full amount.</p>
<p>When the economy is all right and the company legit, the borrower will just roll-over its debt to avoid defaulting its bonds. It just means issuing new bonds to be able to pay back previous bonds and keeps going. The risk is then pushed on the new bondholders. But this asked one question: how do you know that a company is legit?</p>
<h4 id="rating-agencies">Rating agencies</h4>
<p>This is when rating agencies comes into the picture. Their goal is to rate bonds on their default risk. The rating agencies look at companies fundamentals and conclude on a grade. There is quite a lot of different grades and those grades are different between agencies but ultimately, those grades are separated into two categories: “investment grade” or “junk bonds”.</p>
<p>The distinction has a big impact on bonds price because naturally, investors will want a higher yield for a higher risk. If a company starts to struggle financially, its bond might be downgraded by rating agencies and if they happen to fall under the junk bonds umbrella, the market will react by asking for a higher yield and so, the bond price of that company will fall.</p>
<p>This starts a domino effect for the company because now, issuing new bonds will needs a higher coupon’s rate which increase the cost of borrowing for the company and also increase the risk of default its bonds. This is especially bad for companies called “zombies company”. Zombies company are the ones struggling to survive, they usually make barely enough money to sustain its operation and pays its bondholders. And their outlook is not great (this is actually the main difference with a growth stocks, usually running on debt too, but with a highly expected success).</p>
<p>Those zombie companies are in real trouble if rates increase and so are very risky.</p>

<h3 id="the-link-between-the-bond-and-stock-market">The link between the bond and stock market</h3>
<p>Those 2 markets exists all around the world and compete with each others to provide interesting assets to investors. It’s good to keep in mind that big investors (called whale) tend to keep both assets in their portfolio and regularly change their proportions depending on the context.</p>
<p>Peoples in charge of “secure” funds, will tend to rotate a bit of their portfolio out of markets that has seen a high growth and into markets that have dropped. This usually happens at the end of quarter due to some legal requirements (it is good to keep an open mind in those times, dynamics might change fow a week or two before the end of the quarter).</p>
<p>For example, right now (March 31th), innovative stocks which have seen quite a surge through started to decline mid March. On the other hand, the last 6 months has seen the increase in bonds yields. When does funds will start to rotate agressively from stocks into bonds? It’s hard to tell. If yields keep increasing, it will become a more and more interesting assets to rotate into.</p>
<h2 id="the-hyperinflation-case">The Hyperinflation case</h2>
<p>Now that we understand a little bit better market dynamics, let’s look at the special case of hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Hyperinflation is a sudden and strong inflation rate increase (something like 50% inflation rate per month). If we were to experience hyperinflation on the CPI, it would means that in a few weeks, the price of everything, including the baguette could surge: With a 50% rate month-to-month hyperinflation, a baguette which cost $1 today could cost $1.5 next month !</p>
<p>Hyperinflation is impacting the whole economy at once introducting a period of high uncertainty everywhere including in the open market.</p>
<h3 id="impact-on-the-open-market-1">Impact on the open market</h3>
<p>As we’ve already seen, bonds yield (and coupon’s rate when issued) must be higher than the inflation rate to be attractive. In an hyperinflation settings, the market will be taken by surprise and will never cathc up in time. Before you know, all bond investors requires higher yields. The bond market will crash violently, until yields get satysfying again (or until companies disappear).</p>
<p>As bond investors react to hyperinflation, some of them will actually try to front-run (guessing and acting first) it. The inflation expectation will shoot up at the beginning of the high inflation period, accelerating even more hyperinflation imapcts on teh bond market. This will makes bonds yield to overshoot the inflation rate for a while before finally adjusting back to the real inflation rate.</p>
<p>When the bond market crash, companies that need to borrow money at that moment are in trouble. Since all yields are increasing, it means all interest across the boards are increasing. Cost of borrowing shoot up and one would need to issue high interest rate bonds to attract investors. This might not always be possible nor interesting for a company. Globally the US would see a global economic slowdown of loans.</p>
<p>Existing companies that have variable interest rate might suffer even more as they will have to pay more from now on. Zombie companies which have bonds close to their maturity date will probably staet to default them, incresing risk and uncertainty for bond investors, which means that investors will ask for even higher yields.</p>
<p>After the bond market crash, the dynamics goes on with other assets. Short term, inflation might makes all prices across the bord shoot up, but soon investors will feel that there is too much risk and start to rotate out of those other markets. Stocks and crypto will soon start to see all their bubbles pop! Where do they go? At that point, investors move back into the bond market where prices are low and yields high offering a decent enough securities.</p>
<p>The sweet spot to rotate in bonds is when those yields overshoot the future real inflation rate (obviously nobody would know when the bond market reach the dip). But long term investors will start to rotate from other assets to those sweet sweet investment-grade high-yield bonds slowly but surely. And big part of the stock market will crash.</p>

<h3 id="the-bubble-case">The bubble case</h3>
<p>Bubbles appear because the expectation force becomes predominant. Hijacking the human brain, expectation transforms itself again into a self-fulfilling prophecy on a given industry and all the prices start to increase. It starts a succession of human behaviours governed by emotions like FOMO (fear of missing out) where people are pilling up. In the meantime, the random dude which was here by luck will feel validated and might consider himself a kind of guru/expert, arguing that it will keep going up, bringing even more people on the board.</p>
<p>Other players not expecting a bubble on the assets will be short squeezed starting burst of gamma-squeezes and who knows how high the price can shoot up. This will utimately transform the assets into a Ponzi scheme which will naturally hurt all the people late to the party.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a bubble is an asset (or set of assets) hyperinflation. FUD on that asset increase, volatility increes, risk increase. And the usual dynamic of hyperinflation is the result: price increase fast, price overshoot, price decrease again fast, price might also undershoot here and finally, price will settle to its new satisfying value.</p>
<p>The last very good examples is GME. From a value stock, it went through a bubble period and now the future might be even more intersting as it might become a growth stocks if it successfully execute its own transition.</p>
<p>Bubbles tend to happen more when the market tends to be a casino. We tend to call a market a casino when the amount of risks taken by investors is too damn high! This usually is reflectted in high volatility overall. You can measure it with the global margin debt (amount borrowed by people to invest in the open makret). When it increase fast, it is not a good sign as more and more people are risking much more than they have. You can also feel it when you start to observe some bubbles (<del>SPACs 👀</del>, <del>NFTs 👀</del>) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html">funds start to get margin called</a>.</p>
<p>It happens so all of those 3 signals are full on right now. In such market, hyperinflation would crash the whole market as drop in some sectors will margin called big hedge funds and soon, banks discovers that the whole system is tied together and will fall as one which happens (as in 2008, it’s particularly relevant as nothing has been done to prevent the systemic risk of 2008 and we are 13 years later, how time flies!).</p>

<h3 id="the-us-market-and-the-rest-of-the-world">The US market and the rest of the world</h3>
<p>If you really want to have a complete point of view, it is not enough to only look at dynamics inside one country. Countries are also competing and collaborating against and with eachothers all the time. We tend to compare countries with their growth rate but another important indicator is simply the realtive prices of different money.</p>
<p>The ratio between two money is the biggest factor on importation cost and exportation benefit. A strong money (high value relative to others) is good for importing (you can buy foreign things relatively cheap) and bad for exporting (you must sell your own things cheaper). Depending on current strategies, countries around the world try to keep a low or high relative value.</p>
<p>For the US, it’s particularly important to look at ratio betwen the Yuan and the Dollar. China and the USA are deeply connected on mainy subjects including this one. The chineses central banks has been making sure to keep the yuan very low (relatively to the dollar) to ensure that exportation was booming. People were selling things to the US, receiving some dollars. Those dollars were bought by the chinses central bank and reinvested into the most secure investment on earth: US bonds. So much that it ows now more than a trillion dollar of US bonds (it was very efficient to grow their manufacturing and export-driven economy).</p>
<p>This place china on a very special position. China has the power to decide when to devaluate the dollar by starting selling its bonds. But doing so devaluate its debt too and raise its own currency, hurting its export-driven economy. China and America share a very strong bond (sorry for this one) and their destiny are linked. As long as china needs an exporting economy, it is highly unlikely that china start to reverse its strategy. One might want to keep an eye on this in the long run as the effect would be severe. Hopefully, when it starts, it will be all over the news! Beware of the great uncoupling!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-control-inflation">How to control inflation?</h2>
<p>To control inflation and avoid hyperinflation, people have created 2 specials players in the game: governments and central banks. Those have very special capacities and can intervene to change the game dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="governements">Governements</h3>
<p>Governments have been created to lead countries on path of sustainability and well-being. The subject in itself is already complex enough so will consider economic growth as a proxy for “sustainability and well-being” (obviously, this is not true. Climate change doesn’t really feel sustainable to me). At least this is coherent with the world current dominant belief system where, economic growth (GDP) seems to be the to indicator.</p>
<p>Economically, governments have a set of tools to control how money flows in the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tax: Tax are all over the place, they are the cornerstone of wealth redistribution and this redistribution is controlled by governments. Money is taken on every business and individual in a country and redirected to problems that matters (one of the most debated question on earth probably). Tax can be applied specifically to industry (add a tax on oil and all the price linked ot it will increase mechanically), to some other countries (import tax on china), etc. This is a good way to control some part of the inflation rate as you can directly increase or decrease prices.</p></li>
<li><p>Debt: Tax is usually not enough when you want to invest aggressively. This is why governments take on some debt too. Governments debt is special because the risk associated with the loan is considered “risk-free” for powerful country (This is due to the fact that a country tax his population and as long as there is a population, there is no risk that the country does not reimburse its debt). To raise some debt money, governments issue treasury bonds on the open market.</p></li>
<li><p>Laws and Bills. When the above two are not enough, governments an go even further and create laws that ban things directly. You might not know about it but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act">gold has already been completely controlled in the US at some point</a>. They might decide to take control over other assets in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="treasury-bonds">Treasury bonds</h4>
<p>The direct link between governments and the open market lies in the bond market. It is represented by those treasury bonds (T-bonds). Those are important to the whole economy because their coupon’s rate dictate what a “risk-free” interest rate is at a point in time. Some of them are even dynamic to take into account inflation. Any other bonds are considered “riskier” than treasury bonds and so should have an coupon’s rate at least above the coupon’s rate T-bonds on the same period.</p>
<p>Those bonds are very interesting for investors seeking very low risk over a long period of time. Although they are considered a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp">safe-haven</a> in troubled times (recession) or when volatility and uncertainty is high.</p>
<p>The only problem with those T-bonds is the fact the government creates debt when they issue those bonds. Debt is not a problem in itself as long as it is used to fuel strategic investment. As long as an investment is successful, the return over a long period is usually a net positive. But the question remains among economist as nobody really knows when too much debt is actually too much.</p>
<p>A second effect of issuing T-bonds is that governments reduce the money supply on the market to inject it in the real economy: indeed money is transformed from cash to T-bonds and T-bonds are less liquid than cash by definition. Usually it doesn’t matter but in 2019 it actually led to a crisis: the US government issued too much bonds and it started a liquidity issue (<a href="https://blog.independent.org/2019/12/16/how-excessive-federal-spending-sparked-a-liquidity-crisis/">called the repo. crisis</a>. Banks coudln’t lend money overnight fast enough which slow down drastically money flow for a while, forcing an other instituion to intervene!</p>

<h3 id="central-banks">Central banks</h3>
<p>Central banks are the second pillar of today economy. While governments can generate debt as much as they want, central banks can do even better by creating (or destroying) money as much as they want.</p>
<p>Think about it twice. At any point in time, there are institutions that can buy as many things as they want just because the want to. Literally by adding a line in a database somewhere. This is the most powerful intervention that exist on the market and as we all know, with great power comes great responsability. This is why people invented and keep inventing ways of doing this intervention.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to add a disclaimer right here! Economy is not a science (type 2 chaotic system). So even central banks around the world are not completely sure of what happens when they intervene.</strong> To make it quick, the open market is a multi-player cooperative and competitive game with asymetric information all over the places played by humans that are completely irrational and no, irrationality is not averaged off! So no, the market is not efficient (at least, until information flows freely between all the players or irrational entities are removed from the game).</p>
<p>How do they print money you ask? In the past it was the good old printer machine but nowadays it is mainly done on the bond market. Central banks can “monetize debt” which means buying T-bonds. They can also decide to buy any other bonds too.</p>
<p>Why they do that? They do that because they expect their intervention to help their economy achieve some goals. In the US case, you can check the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm">FED press release</a> to keep an eye on its objectives and how it plan to achieve them.</p>
<p><em>sidenote: those press release are sometimes called opem mouth operations (mirroring the open market operations name). People called them like that because it impact global expectations about the future greatly.</em></p>

<h4 id="controlling-key-rates">Controlling key rates</h4>
<p>Outside of directly controlling the money supply, central banks have a high impact on the open market through their communication. Since it would require a huge amount of money to oppose a central bank decision from an investors point of view (it might be impossible), it is always best to ensure that your incentives are aligned with them.</p>
<p>I already talked about T-bonds and their impact on the bond market as a treshold for “risk-free” assets. But the minimal interest rate is actually set by central banks. Let’s focus on the US for now (the dynamic is the same around the world anyway).</p>
<p>In the US, the most important interest rates (called key rates) are the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">federal fund rate</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp">the discount rate</a>:</p>
<h5 id="the-federal-fund-rate">The federal fund rate</h5>
<p>It is not a real rate but only a target (objectif) fixed by the Federal reserve. It is defined for all interbank interest rates. The goal of the FED is to bring the effective fund rate (average of all interbank interest rates) as close as possible to its target. It does so using open market/mouth operations and controlling other rates. This is the mother of all rate as the effective fund rate impact how banks make loans and so define a minimal interest rate for any other loans.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=D3Ii" alt="Fed fund rate" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fed fund rate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The problem as we see in this graph, is that the FED tends to be reactionary to the efffective fund rate. Meaning that the FED does not announce a new FED fund rate which clash with the effective one, it usually move the rate before it talks.</p>
<h5 id="the-discount-rate">The discount rate</h5>
<p>It is the interest rate central banks charge private banks for short-term loans. When private banks can’t borrow money from other private banks (supply problem, loan too big), they start to ask their central banks. The interbank rate has to be lower to it as banks could then just makes loan to the central bank instead of other banks. So it will either incentivize banks to borrow from the central bank or not. This impact the global money supply on the market as central banks are the only ones creating/destroying money.</p>
<h5 id="the-interest-rate-of-excess-reserves-ioer">The interest rate of excess reserves (IOER)</h5>
<p>It is the rate the FED pays other banks for their excess reserve. The excess reserve is the amount the keep in their reserve above what is needed by regulation. By increasing it, banks are incentivized to keep more money in bank reducing the money supply, slowing down their lending dynamic.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=D3J5" alt="discount rate and IOER" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">discount rate and IOER</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is why those FED meeting are so important, their decisions on those meeting impact the whole economy at once. they will mention any rate change, provide and update their forecast for the coming years but also announce if they plan some <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">(called open market operations, OMO)</a>.</p>
<h4 id="open-market-operations">Open market operations</h4>
<p>Open market operations are their last tools in their arsenal. This is how they create or destroy money by directly buying (money injection) or selling (money destruction) bonds in the open market. As I already said, new open market operations can be invented at any time but let’s look at the one that we know of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-yield-curve-control-4797189">Yield curve control (YCC, continuous control)</a> The FED targets a long term interest rate by buying and/or selling treasury bonds. The amount of bonds to be bought per month is decided and revised at every FOMC meeting. The total number of bonds needed is uncapped. The goal is to control supply/demand on treasury bonds to keep their yield at the targeted long term interest rate. treasury-bonds yields are completely controlled by the central bank forcing the bond market to deal with the targeted risk-free rate decided by the FED. It is a direct way to maintain a interest rate bellow the inflation rate.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing (QE, instantaneous injection)</a> The FED buys a massive, but specific, amount of bonds at a given time, reducing the supply of those bonds on the bond market. Those bonds are not “government-based” bonds but can be any kind of bond (even junk bonds). It increases their value and so decrease their yield while incresing money supply on the market. This is a good way to keep the bond market around low yield overall. The goal here is to inject liquidity at a given time, not target a specific interest rate: after the move, the market comes back to its usual dynamic.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money">Helicopter money (people QE, instantaneous injection)</a> This part is done in tandem with governments. A government will sign a law providing money directly to the people. That money comes from a debt increase from the governement (issuing T-bonds) while the central bank monetize it (buy the T-bonds). The term “helicopter money” refers to the direct deposit in people bank accounts. It’s a form of quantitative easing but directed at the population directly and not at the open market. It is known to increase demand and inflation more directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Stimulus This is just an umbrella term that is mainly used by the government to package a set of bills together. It can contain any mix of previous tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There exist an infinite number of variations but those have the strongest impact on the open market.The purpose of this post is not to give a complete overview.</p>

<h3 id="the-gold-reserve-act">The Gold Reserve Act</h3>
<p>In 1934, The US government enacted the Gold Reserve Act. The US were in a terrible deflationnary period due to great depression of 1929 and needed a way to boost the country growth. As we’ve seen, theb est is ti have a little bit of inflation to ensure a booming economy. The government response was to raise the gold price of more than 50% and forbidding US citizens and institutions to hold on it. People were more than happy to sell their gold to the government since it was a nice 50% increase overnight! But it was not restricted to the US citiziens, people all around the world started to sell gold to the US.</p>
<p>This big selling increase drastically the mount of dollars in the world which devalued the money, raising inflation. Since the era was very deflationnary, this actually raised back the US inflation <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/inflation-rate-in-1934">rate around 2.5%</a> (high inflation in a delfationnary period). At the time, The US had an economy much more centered on exportation which were also boosted by the dollar devaluation.</p>
<p>As a side effect, it is interesting to note that the US ended with a s**t amount of gold. The 2nd world ward increased even more the quantity of gold owned by the US government making it the largest gold reserve. This forced other country to acuumulate something else in their central bank. And that something else had to be closed to gold, naturally it would be the dollar propelling it as the world reserve currency.</p>
<p>Any idea, what assets could be really interesting to hold en masse in the coming decades?</p>

<h3 id="the-obama-stimulus-and-2008-2009-bond-case">The Obama stimulus and 2008-2009 bond case</h3>
<p>In 2009, post housing crisis, Obama injected 800 Billion into the economy (It was big at the time). Those 800 billions were created thanks to tax cuts and treasury bonds creation. As expected the debt increase drastically and people were scared that all those T-bonds would <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/01/20/markets/bondcenter/credit/index.htm">make the bond market crash</a>. <a href="https://business.time.com/2011/03/10/the-worlds-largest-bond-fund-gets-out-of-us-debt-good-news/">Some big bonds investors</a> were even advocating that the crash was upton them and started selling all their bonds. It could have been the start of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>But it did not happens. Why is that? Mainly, thanks to the FED. It extended her pledge to keep interest low thorugh the years by buying treasury bonds. In 2011, it even increases <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TREAST">the rates of buying</a> pushing bonds price even higher and keep yields very low.</p>
<p>An other reason is inflation expectation. The Obama government stimulus succeeded at restarting the economy growth, lowering the fear of a recession year after year. As people believed more and more that inflation will be kept low, they kept buying new bonds. On the overall this continue to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRLTLT01USM156N">reduce bonds yields across that period and until today</a>.</p>

<p>Following is a summary of what we’ve seen. Again, remember that those are high-level interaction and the market is unpredictable and any surprising events will probably impact the market more short-terms than those dynamics.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: I’ve created multiple scenarios because those were hard to merge into a single big one.</em></p>
<!-- TODO: draw them https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery -->
<p>Instead of spending time writing a paragraph, let me just pus a flywheel to you: y7t6gt</p>
<!-- First case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED follow it -->
<ul>
<li>Inflation rate increase: the price of things increase -&gt; Cost of existing debt decrease (good for the existing borrower) -&gt; Commodities price increase (commodities stocks increase) -&gt; Real estate price increase (real estate stocks increase) -&gt; Companies selling goods make more money -&gt; FED decides to increase the federal fund rate and discount rate to follow the inflation rate -&gt; interbank loan rate increase -&gt; everyone loan and credit rate increase -&gt; cost of borrow increase (not good for the new borrower) -&gt; borrowing, in general, slows down -&gt; Companies might not be able to borrow anymore (or issue new bonds) -&gt; zombie companies might struggle to pay back their principals (can’t roll-over existing debt) -&gt; junk-bonds default increase -&gt; Investors try to rotate out of junk bonds before it happens -&gt; other assets value increase -&gt; Growth companies functioning on debt might struggle to borrow -&gt; Rating agency might decrease their grade -&gt; Some companies move from “investment-grade” to “junk” bonds (fallen angel) -&gt; Drastic bond yield increase -&gt; at the beginning (or before) short-term investor rotates out the bond market to avoid bonds price decrease -&gt; other assets value increase -&gt; at the end (when yield stabilize at a new level), short term investors rotate back in to gather high yield bonds -&gt; other assets value decrease -&gt; bonds treasury yield increase -&gt; bonds market decrease and so bond yields increase -&gt; long term investors (pension funds) rotate internally of the bond market to gather those high yields bonds</li>
</ul>
<!-- Second case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED don't follow it [CURRENT SITUATION] -->
<ul>
<li>Inflation rate increase: the price of things increase -&gt; FED does not like it and uses QE to increase the generic bond price and/or YCC to ensure treasury yields are constant and/or keep key rates low -&gt; increase inflation in the open market (month injection) -&gt; The money dump should increase other assets value (including the stock market) -&gt; real treasury yield starts to be negative -&gt; Long term bond investors (pension fund) might not like it and rotate out of the bond market -&gt; A fight between the FED and other bond investors start to kick in (FED wants to keep low yield, bonds investors want to increase yield) -&gt; depending on the winner, more or fewer bond investors rotate in or out (2008 crisis)</li>

<h2 id="why-are-we-talking-about-it-now">Why are we talking about it now?</h2>
<!-- TODO: finish this part
- Reopening the economy
- Existing inflation
- bond yield increase

- Where is the money?
-->
<p>https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-hyperinflation-definition-causes-and-examples-3306097 - printing money (stimulus) and demand-pull (reopening the economy) are both here. One has already been quite hot and the other one is about to bu unleashed.</p>
<p>And, as of March 19th, if we look at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">last 20 years in price change</a> we can see mainly three things: - The average inflation rate is around 2% even though it always fluctuates. - Inflation increased sharply before the housing crisis and sharply decrease during and shortly after. - The COVID, on the other hand, Literally froze prices (the rate went down to 0) and it’s starting to increase again.</p>
<p>So, why do people are talking <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=inflation">about inflation now</a>? Why do we see more information about hyperinflation online?</p>
<p>Exactly because the rate already increased while the economy was shut down and reopening the economy might be the match that can light the hyperinflation rocket.</p>
<p>The second problem is that we are in a casino market and we already see the effect with hedge funds being margin called and their rippled effect onto the banks: - Margin debt is high as f*** - SPACs and NFTs share way too many traits with the internet bubble - Everyone is a genius (people suffers risk-addiction)</p>
<h3 id="what-should-we-do">What should we do?</h3>
<p>I don’t know but whatever you do, keep in mind that risk is all over the market.</p>
<p>On one side you could be bullish: - <a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1370569377284812809">Third stimulus only 3 months after the second</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1377062211634479104">Infrastructure stimulus</a></p>
<p>On the other side, it looks ready to burst (beware, perma bear spotted): - <a href="https://zensecondlife.blogspot.com/2021/03/a-consensus-of-implosion.html">A consensus of implosion</a></p>
<p>For me, we now are in a landmine growth territory. If you move forward securely, you should be allright for a while but don’t step on a landmine or you lose a leg.</p>
<p>Where do those landmines are coming? From the accelerating increase in margins. Everybody is ready to make a shit ton of money, money comes from all over the place to the stock market. But because of that, surprising events can move stocks quite agressively because some dudes will be margin called somewhere.</p>

<h3 id="ok-but-where-to-invest">Ok but where to invest?</h3>
<p>First, the global market will probably see a strong correction. If your long, you don’t care as Cathie is explaining here. If you are swinging, might be time to be bearish. If you are intraday, come on, do you even care about macro shift??</p>
<p>Before the correction, I would try to get some bucks and ETF that contains growth stock by shorting them or buying some puts. But we don’t know when it will happen maybe you aim large.</p>
<p>Another intereting play is some call options on the VIX. It is very risky, but any downward movement will make this index flys up.</p>
<p>After the correction is done, tear apart ETF in commodities, energy, bank and find value stock. Invest in those.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with complex investment vehicles, you could look into those but in that field, you are on your own.</p>
