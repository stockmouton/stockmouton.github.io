- What would be the impact of hyperinflation?
- Surprise and strong inflation would make investors stop investing in bonds with a lower yield than inflation. (they might invest  in riskier bonds, in stocks or other bond markets, not the US)
- Supply/demand will lower bonds price, increasing their yield
- The dynamic will settle to a new yield level.
- At that point, companies that need investment for growth might not want to borrow money at a high-interest rate. (growth stocks will suffer)
- Existing companies having dynamic interest rates might be in trouble and die
- Rating agencies might downgrade many companies increasing, even more, the struggle
- You might start to see bonds default
- Those companies stocks will plummet or even die. It will be a landmine for stock investors. Because of that people might invest elsewhere in general for a while. leading to a new market crash.
- Remember money flow between countries, investment vehicles, cryptocurrencies etc.

- So you don't want hyperinflation. How can we keep it under control?
- GOV -> economic growth (growth > inflation: nobody cares about inflation, plenty of interesting investment opportunities)
- FED -> control FED rate (the mother of all interest rates)

- The GOV can: borrow money at a low rate all the time (risk-free debt) and cut taxes to lower the cost of production
- The FED can: buy/sell bonds to control US bond market yield level, FIX the FED rate, implement diverse policies to keep rate lows.
BUT
- The ultimate indicator of the inflation rate: creating a debt or injecting money into the economy has some drawbacks.
- As a country, you have to compete with the rest of the world concerning investment opportunities.

- All right, but what could start hyperinflation? Reopening economy with low supply and slow growth + helicopter money.

Ok, so what to look for?
- inflation rate
- 3y/10y/30y Treasury yields (the market pricing in expected inflation rate)
- Listen to the FED + FED target rate and open market operations
- Listen to the gov and tax cuts/debt
- signals of economic growth: unemployment level, GDP,
- population sentiment about inflation
- bubbles, casino behaviours (look at margin debt, )
- Value stocks/ growth stocks and subsequent ETF.
- money pairs
- Other parts of the worlds that compete with your country. For the US, China should be watched.

I would already secure myself against a crash
 -->
<!-- # OLD TL;DR
- Inflation is real and observed in many sectors (housing, energy)
- The US Government can hide it because it can manipulate the CPI and this is what it usually refers to in public discourse.
- The FED maintains a low FED rate but it might have to announce that it will increase its long term target rate in the coming years.
- Reopening the economy might increase the inflation rate and could be the match that light the inflation rocket leading to hyperinflation
- Interest rates will increase all over the board and loans, in general, will get very expensive
- Those doomsday predictions might lead to some real inflation expectation which would lead to the bond market crash
- Growth stocks will suffer and "zombie" companies will die
- Value and commodities stocks will surge (after a global and quick market correction)
- The FED is buying time with the stimmy and QE
- In a very short term, you can grab some nice juicy percents in the stock market thanks to stimmy
- It might be a good time to assure yourself against sudden corrections
- Remember, you can't be out of the market because of hyperinflation if you don't want to lose buying power
- So you better pick wisely your commodities-value stocks for some nice growth!
- And short some wisely picked ETF and complex financial instrument to profit from those corrections just in case. -->
<h1 id="hyperinflation-and-market-dynamics-a-primer">HyperInflation and market dynamics: A primer</h1>
<p>Meh!</p>
<p>I’ve been lurking in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/options/">Reddit r/options</a> lately and I stumbled upon this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m4ffmx/long_commodities_short_bonds_protection_against/">post</a> predicting doomsday, hyperinflation, the crash of the bond market and subsequently, the stock market.</p>
<p>I don’t know if thoses hypotheses hold or not. But I saw an opportunity to fill some holes in my knowledge about what would trigger this doomsday crash. So, I decided to explore the subject and write a quick recap about this hyperinflation thing and why it matters.</p>
<p>It is in no way state-of-the-art thinking nor perfectly accurate. The devil always hides in the details and this is not the aim of this post. On top of that, it took me quite a while to research and write this piece os it might feel a little bit late to be published. Remember to do your own DD, apply what you learn, make your own prediction, observe what happens, learn from your mistakes and repeat!</p>
<p>Also, I’m quite new to the finance subject overall so take this post as a primer on market dynamics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this is not financial advices and only some educational material.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<!-- TODO -->
<h2 id="a-quick-overview-of-the-game">A quick overview of the game</h2>
<p>Before diving into what is inflation and how it impacts investors, let’s look at the game itself.</p>
<p>We are playing the investment game. In this game, you have investors on one side and assets on the other. Investors try to make money by investing in those assets and assets try to attract investors money so they can grow.</p>
<p>This game is played all around the world, 24h/7: it’s a global economic competition and collaboration system.</p>
<h3 id="investors">investors</h3>
<p>Investors plan is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest money in assets</li>
<li>Wait</li>
<li>Profit (get back more money)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficult part is in “picking the right asset”. Investors have a nearly infinite amount of possible investments in this world: Housing, startup, stock, bonds, derivatives, art, crypto, NFTs, etc. you name it. And, access to all those investment all around the world is now at the fingertips and in real-time.</p>
<p>So, anyone can be an investor. All one needs is the will to follow the simple plan. The good news is that one can adapt any part of it to fit one’s own requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of the investment: from $0.01 to $1 Trillion.</li>
<li>The amount of time one is wish/must to let money in the asset: from 1 millisecond to a century.</li>
<li>The amount of risk one wish/must take: from risk-free assets to lottery ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the investor point of view, it is all about risk management to make money. Investors can measure raw success with some simple math. As a first estimate, we can look directly at our return on investment (ROI):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Final value of the investment} - \text{Cost of the investment}}{\text{Cost of the investment}} \]</span></p>
<p>Once one decides how much one is willing to invest. From that pont it is good to consider a ROI goal: - how much you want to make? - How long are you ready to wait?</p>
<h4 id="multiple-kinds-of-investors">Multiple kinds of investors</h4>
<p>Depending on those previous requirements and goal, investors exist in every kind. I won’t go into details but you might want to look how any of those behaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institution</li>
<li>Pension funds: invest a lot, wait a lot, lower risk to maximum. Needs to rebalance portfiolio regularly to minize the risk (Beware of end of quarter!)</li>
<li>Funds: invest a lot, wait moderatly. Depending of their style they might be very risky or not. You must do your own work per fund to understands their behaviours</li>
<li>High frequency traders (market makers): Invest tiny amounts, very very fast, low risk. Their business is on the economy of scale.</li>
<li>Retail traders: you, me, everyone trading from home. Invest a very little comparing to other actors but are many which in our times, start to make a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you want to look for with those different investors if their generic strategy or if there is any requirement by law on some of them. One concept I tend to emphasize is assets rotation (moving form one kind assets of to other assets).</p>
<p>We will dig more later on, but as an example: because bonds price were going down and stocks price were going up for the past year. It was expeced to see assets rotation from stocks to bonds at the end of this month explaining part of sotck going down for the last 2 weeks of march.</p>
<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>
<p>On the other side, assets try to attract investors money. The need to satisfy any kind of investors spurs into reality any kind of assets: secure, risky, volatile, constant, expensive, cheap, complex, etc. Any opportunity void will soon be filled by the open market.</p>
<p>To attract investors, assets are designed to make a promise of a nice return. Sometimes, the promise is strongly grounded in financial mechanics (like bonds), sometimes it’s just a pure promise, no ties attached (like stocks).</p>
<p>Their prices in the open market are driven by multiple forces among is supply and demand but noy only. Another very important force is inflation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-inflation">What is inflation?</h2>
<p>Inflation (and deflation) are words that refer to the rate of change in the price of “things”. Understand “things” very broadly here: food, energy, house, stocks, bonds, ETF, etc. Anything that has a price.</p>
<p>To get the inflation rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>One look at the current price of things now: <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span>.</li>
<li>One wait some time <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>.</li>
<li>One look again at those same prices <span class="math inline">\(p_{t + \Delta t}\)</span> and you calculate the ratio:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{inflation rate} = R_{inf} = \frac{p_{t + \Delta t}}{p_t}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(R_{inf} \gt 1\)</span> we use the term inflation.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(R_{inf} \lt 1\)</span>, we use the term deflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: notice how it is similar to the investor simple plan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inflation rate can be measured for anything and people indeed measure the inflation of everything. Having a good way to measure inflation correctly is still a subject of heafty debate because it really depends on how one lives. But the one that is usually taken when people talk about inflation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index">Consumer price index (CPI)</a>.</p>
<p>People tend to focus on it because it is supposed to represent the cost of living for the urban lower and middle class. It contains a basket of goods one has to pay for when living in cities. If you live outside of cities, you want to look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index">Personal Consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: The CPI is an average of different prices, because of that and the fact that governements can change prices thanks to different tax policies makes people are wary that it is not a very good signal. It is usually considered a lagging signal in the sense that it is probably the last one reacting to inflation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inflation in itself is not a problem, it is actually good when it is happening at a moderate rate. As long as inflation fluctuates slowly, the economy can adapt smoothly. Problems arise when quick change happens (like hyperinflation or hyper deflation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: Near-zero inflation or deflation is considered harmful for the economy but for other reasons (signs of a worsening economy in general).</em></p>

<h3 id="impact-on-investors">Impact on investors</h3>
<p>Inflation impacts directly investors because it lowers the value of money which impact what we call the “purchasing power”.</p>
<p>The purchasing power is the power to buy things: If $100 this year allows you to buy fewer things than $100 5 years ago, then you lost some purchasing power. It matters directly to everyone because it is the link betwen money and reality. And since the inflation rate measure how prices change, it becomes the direct measure of how much investors need to grow their amount of money to keep their purchasing power:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{ROI} &gt; \text{inflation rate} \]</span></p>
<p>This is why people tends to take inflation directly into account when computing returns or other measures. You can easily know when that happens because people add the word “real” before the measure. For example the real ROI is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{real ROI} = \text{ROI} - \text{inflation rate}\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sidenote: The actual investors benefit per year must be computed by taking into account many other costs like taxes and the cost of living during that investment period</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="impact-on-the-open-market">Impact on the open market</h3>
<p>The real ROI is easily computable when we look at the past. But things start to be more complicated when we talk about the future. If we want to anticipate what will be our real ROI on a given period we now have two numbers to guess for that period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expected ROI</li>
<li>The expected inflation rate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sidenote: beware now, when you listen to any kind of forcasters, remember that the open market is considered to be <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/first-second-order-chaos/">a second-order chaotic system</a> and by definition is nearly unpredictable. And remember for yourself that one of the most pervasive and unavoidable bias of the human specie is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> among other biased emotions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to add more objectivity in there, the scientific method is the way to go with tools like statistics but for the future we are left with gut feeling, beliefs, reactive behaviours, etc.</p>
<p>Those beliefs, when shared by many are a strong force that also impacts the open market because they create expectations. Expectations when shared by enough people cane become a self-fulfilling prophecy: If enough people want an asset to go up or down, it will indeed happen.</p>
<p>Why I’m talking about that? Because expected inflation in particular is a very powerful force in the open market and in particular the bond market as this one is more rigid and usually necessitate long investment periods.</p>
<p>We are going to dive into the basics of the bond and stock market to understand how those forces interact with each other. We leave out of the picture financial derivatives (FD) (options, futures, etc.). We will mainly talk about the US open market but it is important to remember the assets in the US open market competes with other assets in other open market around the world .</p>

<h2 id="bonds-and-stocks">Bonds and Stocks</h2>
<p>Bonds and stocks represent two very different way to invest. Bonds are loans and stocks are a pure investment. The main difference is that for bonds, you have a contract dictating how much return you will make when you buy it, and for stocks, you are mainly buying a promise that the company will grow and make more money.</p>
<h3 id="stocks">Stocks</h3>
<p>When you invest in stocks, you buy shares. It means you own a part of the company. The overall value of the company on the market (market cap) is represented by the sum of all those share price.</p>
<p>A second benefit of buying those shares is that if the company is profitable, an investor can receive money regularly (dividens). Supply/demands and exectation of the company’s performance are key forces that impact share prices. The more the company is attractive the more share price will increase.</p>

<h4 id="growth-stocks-versus-value-stock">Growth stocks versus value stock</h4>
<p>Besides your belief individual investors tends to end up in two categories: value or growth investors. To keep it simple, one bets on what we call “growth stocks” which have a high potential but needs a lot of investment and loans(with bonds) to realize it. The other one bets on so-called “value stocks” which seeks the opposite undervalued profitable companies.</p>
<p>Both have a high potential, the first one is expected to grow very much and so its share price too. The other one is consideted undervalued and so should go through a positive correction of its share price in the future. For examples, Tesla is a growth stock and GME was a value stock (this case is interesting because it might transforms itself into a growth stocks!).</p>
<p>Outside of those two shiny category, you have many other kind of stocks in every industry: penny stocks (share price under 1$), zombie companies (hardly making it), etc. All of them contains different risks and attract different kind of investors.</p>

<h3 id="bonds">Bonds</h3>
<p>When you invest in bonds, things are very different. First, bonds are not only issued from corporations but also municipals, states and governments. Second, a bond is issued with more properties than stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The face value: the original price at which the bond is issued</li>
<li>The coupon rate (interest rate): Annual percentage of the face value paid to the bondholder. Can be fixed or variable.</li>
<li>Maturity date: the date at which the amount of borrowed money (Called “the principal” = the face value) is given back to the bondholder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonds are interesting because they lower the risk of losing money. Let’s say one buys some bonds when they are issued:</p>
<ul>
<li>One pays the face value of the bonds to acquire them.</li>
<li>One then receives a fixed-income equal to the coupon annual payment every year.</li>
<li>One gets back its money at the maturity date.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the exact dynamic of a loan. When one lends money, one expects to be fully reimbursed by the end of the loan and receive a little extra in the meantime.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-after-bonds-are-issued">What happens after bonds are issued?</h4>
<p>After bonds are issued, they end up on the bond market where their price is subject to the usual market forces. Bonds are competing with eachother and more generally with other assets which means that their current price is not fixed and can fluctuate: this is why we give a different name to the price of the bond when it is issued (the face value).</p>
<p>Now, because all the properties of the bonds are fixed (face value, coupon’s rate and maturity date), but its price remains dynamic, it introduces a new notion: the yield.</p>
<p>The bond yield can be seen as its dynamic interest rate and is calculated relatively to its current price:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{bond yield} = \frac{\text{annual coupon payment}}{\text{current bond price}}\]</span></p>
<p>As a quick example, a bond with a face value of <span class="math inline">\(1000 with a fixed coupon&#39;s rate of 5% per year leads to a total coupon annual payment of 50\)</span>. if the price of the bonds decrease to 900$ the yield is now <span class="math inline">\(\frac{50}{900} = 0.55 = 55%\)</span> which is higher than the original coupon’s rate and makes the bond more interesting. Not only one would buy that bond at lower price, but one would also receives a higher annual interest rate relative to its investment. Also, if one would keep it until maturity date, one would still receive the full face (which is still $1000).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: <em>By definition, the yield is inversely linked to the bond price: if the yield increase, the bond price decrease and vice-versa.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonds yields are a good measure for investors because you can compare it directly to the inflation rate or your expected inflation rate for the period of time you want to hold onto it. This means that the current inflation rate has a direct impact on bonds yield: Outside of any external intervention, supply and demands on bonds should move their price such that their yield satisify the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{yield} &gt; \text{inflation rate} \Rightarrow \text{current price} &lt; \frac{\text{coupon&#39;s value}}{\text{inflation rate}}\]</span></p>
<p>So far so good. So what is the catch?</p>
<p>Bonds don’t provide a high yield comapred to other potential assets and they still suffer from 2 kinds of risk.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-perceive-bonds-risk">How to perceive bonds risk?</h4>
<p>The first risk is inflation. Since bonds are quite long term investment because of the low yield they provide. They are quite susceptible to expected inflation. As we’ve seen bonds yield will have to go up if inflation goes up because investors won’t hold on bonds that make them lose some purchasing powers.</p>
<p>This means that if you buy a bond and you plan to sell it, you better hope that the inflation rate will not increase. Because, first your real ROI will be lower and second, you will have to sell your bonds at a lower price. So investors spend some times trying to predict inflation rate to make sure they are buying bonds at a too high prices.</p>
<p>This is why a stabilized inflation rate is not dangerous to the open market. If it does not move, it does not impact bonds yield.</p>
<p>This inflation risk is especially important for long-term bonds (&gt;3 years until maturity date). Now for bonds that have their maturity date much closer, there is another risk: the borrower might not be able to return the principals on maturity date. We say that the bond default.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see a bond default before the maturity date because the coupon’s annual payment should not be very high for the borrower. At maturity on the other hand, the total principal is huge. And if the borrower as not used the money in a sufficiently smart way to be able to grow enough and make enough money, it might be in trouble to reimburse the full amount.</p>
<p>When the economy is all right and the company legit, the borrower will just roll-over its debt to avoid defaulting its bonds. It just means issuing new bonds to be able to pay back previous bonds and keeps going. The risk is then pushed on the new bondholders. But this asked one question: how do you know that a company is legit?</p>
<h4 id="rating-agencies">Rating agencies</h4>
<p>This is when rating agencies comes into the picture. Their goal is to rate bonds on their default risk. The rating agencies look at companies fundamentals and conclude on a grade. There is quite a lot of different grades and those grades are different between agencies but ultimately, those grades are separated into two categories: “investment grade” or “junk bonds”.</p>
<p>The distinction has a big impact on bonds price because naturally, investors will want a higher yield for a higher risk. If a company starts to struggle financially, its bond might be downgraded by rating agencies and if they happen to fall under the junk bonds umbrella, the market will react by asking for a higher yield and so, the bond price of that company will fall.</p>
<p>This starts a domino effect for the company because now, issuing new bonds will needs a higher coupon’s rate which adds increase the cost of borrow for the company and actually increase the risk of that company defaulting its bonds even higher. This is especially bad for companies called “zombies company”. Zombies company are the ones struggling to survive, they usually make barely enough money to sustain its operation and pays its bondholders. And their outlook is not great (this is actually the main difference with a growth stocks, usually running on debt too, but with a highly expected success).</p>
<p>Those zombie companies are in real trouble if rates increase and so are very risky.</p>

<h3 id="the-link-between-the-bond-and-stock-market">The link between the bond and stock market</h3>
<p>Those 2 markets exists all around the world and compete with each others to provide interesting assets to investors. The important to keep in mind is that big investors (called whale) tend to keep in their portfolio both of those assets.</p>
<p>Yet, depending on the context, they will rotate part of their portfolio from one to the other regularly which can creates strong movements sometimes. It is always intersting to keep track of high level signals of those 2 markets to see when such rotation might happens.</p>
<p>For example, right now (March 31th), the stock market is in the “longest bull market in history”. If bonds yields keeps incresing, it will soon start to become an interesting asset for a rotation from stocks to bonds. (One might start to think that stocks will see a correction soon while bonds look attractive).</p>
<h2 id="hyperinflation">Hyperinflation</h2>
<p>Hyperinflation is a sudden and strong inflation rate increase. Concretely, if it happens in 24h and it amount to 50%, it would mean that the baguette you were buying at 1$ so far, cost now 1.5$! It would be quite f**ed up. It’s never that quick but even if it takes a year it would be extremely difficult for many people to keep a decent life.</p>
<h3 id="impact-on-the-open-market-1">Impact on the open market</h3>
<!-- I need to add the "bind window", right after hyperinflation it's open bar to buy safe, long maturity date bonds -->
<p>As we’ve already seen, bonds yield (or the interest rate at issuance) must be higher than inflation to attract investors. But if the inflation rate increase rapidly, what you quickly see will be a demand for higher yields bonds and so existing bonds price will crash and stabilize at a new equilibrium satisfying the new demand for higher yields.</p>
<p>But the impact does not stop here.</p>
<p>First, investors that have high inflation expectation will start to sell bonds before the price decrease adding more fuel to fire. Second, companies that need to borrow money might not be able to do so because interest rates for new bonds must be high too which means that you will have to pay an expensive price regularly for your debt. Third, existing companies that have variable interest rate might suffer directly because they might have to pay more per year. Fourth, existing companies that already borrow money using bonds and are getting closer to their maturity date might not be able to reimburse. When interest rates stay the same though a long period, it is no problem as the company will issue new bonds, to reimburse the principals of the old one. But now that interest rose greatly, it might be impossible for it and they might default their bonds.</p>
<p>All those effects increase risk in the bond market, and investors will ask for even higher yields.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t stop here because after the bond market crash, now investors can find high yields in the bond market. And investors will start to rotate from other assets to bonds. This usually has a big impact on the stock market as a lot of money will come from it and so you should see some part of the stock market crash. Especially bubbles.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: usually the bond market crash and stock market are synchronised because the open market is full of robot and reactionary investors.</em></p>
<p>Remember that we are only looking at investors point of view, but actually, this will be very bad for the economy overall. Investments will slow down, economic growth will not recover directly you end up in a recession period which is a correction for the real economy. I’m not even talking about the struggles the lower class would face and the fact that you might want to increase the minimum wage which would increase demands and potentially increase even more the inflation rate. There are lots of twisted feedback loops regarding inflation.</p>
<p>For the economy and the market, the goal is to get back to a new equilibrium quickly, or even better, if we have to go down at least control this downward movement to avoid drastic changes in people life.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-price-of-things-change-by-the-way">Why the price of things change by the way?</h3>
<p>To understand why the reopening economy can propel the inflation rate higher, one must understand why things cost what they cost.</p>
<p>To make that simple, there 3 forces basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply and demand</li>
<li>Cost of production</li>
<li>Risk of buying/selling</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll look more into the cost of production and risk later. But one won’t be surprised to learn that with a slow economy, demand, in general, has fallen (yes, some fields have seen a surge, as the tech industry, but the general direction is a lower demand). In reaction, industries lowered their supply accordingly. When you reopen your economy and consumption starts again, The supply needs to be ramped up and people will probably be quite excited to consume again. Which could create natural inflation. It will increase demands with a low supply, it will increase the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Cost of production contains three major part: cost of raw material (important cost), labour cost, the financial cost (loan interest rate) Flywheel: reopening -&gt; increase demand -&gt; increase inflation rate -&gt; increase rates -&gt; increase cost of productions -&gt; increase inflation -&gt; increase bond yield -&gt; decrease bonds prices</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The FOMC meeting on March 17th validated this point. As they said, they expect a “transient inflation rate above 2% in the coming months”. Meaning they expect to see a rise in the inflation rate, but it will be temporary and stay under control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-bubble-case">The bubble case</h3>
<p>Bubbles appear because the expectation force becomes predominant. Hijacking the human brain, expectation transforms itself into a self-fulfilling prophecy on a given industry and all the prices start to increase. Using humans natural fears of FOMO (fear of missing out), people are pilling up and the price keeps going up, validating the thesis of first-comers who tend to become gurus on the fly, arguing that it will keep going up, bringing even more people on the board.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s even worse as mechanics like short squeeze and so-called gamma squeeze come to the party to increase volatility even more. Until the Ponzi scheme dries up.</p>
<p>Rarely, people note that a bubble is an asset (or set of assets) hyperinflation. It creates a lot of volatility, increases risk drastically. The usual dynamic of hyperinflation is a price overshoot and a settlement in-between the top price and the original price.</p>
<p>Bubbles tend to happen more when the market tends to a casino. A market tends to a casino when volatility increase overall, margin debt increase fast and you start to see a clear trend. ~SPACs 👀~</p>

<h2 id="governments-and-central-banks">Governments and central banks</h2>
<p>Among all the player that are on the open markets, t20 kinds are very special: governments and central banks. Those player are specials because they have special skills that other investors do not have.</p>
<h3 id="governements">Governements</h3>
<p>Governments are elected by the people and their jobs is to help the country improve the average happiness of its people at any timescale. In our dominant belief system, economic growth seems to be the mother of all indicators. Even though I don’t believe it’s true, let’s keep things simple by saying the government job is to ensure a booming global economy for its country.</p>
<p>To do so, governments have a set of tools to improve their people life (outside of going to wars and use brute force on others in general):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax. By increasing/reducing taxes in different sectors they directly impact the cost of things of those sectors. This is a good way to control some part of the inflation rate.</li>
<li>Debt. Because they can tax people forever (unless the country itself fails), governments can borrow a lot of money on the open market. Government can issue bonds that are “investment grades” by default and considered “risk-free” as it will always pay its interest and the principals at the maturity date. Notice here that governments debt is due to the market which is private entities.</li>
<li>Laws and Bills. Using the first 2, governments control a gigantic amount of money that they can redirect to different places in the economy. They usually are the only ones that can start tremendous investment which benefits society at large. They could also ban things, you might not know about it but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act">gold has already been completely controlled by the US at some point</a>. They might decide to take control over other assets in the future…</li>
</ul>
<p>Governments impact the bond market because of their treasury bonds. Since those are risk-free, it gives a threshold to the market of what a “risk-free” interest rate is. As long as that rate stays above the inflation rate, those bonds are very interesting for investors seeking very low risk over a long period.</p>
<p><em>Side note: it is interesting to note that toot much borrowing from the government can also generate a <a href="https://blog.independent.org/2019/12/16/how-excessive-federal-spending-sparked-a-liquidity-crisis/">crisis</a>. In those thing it always needed to find the sweet spot.</em></p>

<h3 id="central-banks">Central banks</h3>
<p>Central banks are the second pillar of today economy. While governments can generate debt as much as they want, central banks can do better by creating money as much as they want. Of course, it has a broader impact.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the actuals tools of the FED to control the overall economy, think about it twice. At any point in time, if needed, there is an institution that can buy as many things as it wants magically. Literally by adding a line in software somewhere. Central banks don’t want to distort the open market too much. This is why they only directly impact the bond market and especially treasury bonds.</p>
<p>But they still have tremendous power on the market dynamics. You better hope that their interest is aligned with yours because if the guys in charge believe they have to do something, then they will. This is why central banks statement are closely monitored and you don’t want to be on the way of this 100pound gorilla, do you?</p>

<h4 id="central-banks-tooling">Central banks tooling</h4>
<p>How central banks print money? In the past, they printed money for real but nowadays, it’s mainly done through the banking system and the open market. Outside of directly controlling the money supply, central banks can also change the current economic incentives. They do so by setting interest rates that impact the whole economy. And again, they can officially or not do so. Let’s see what are those interest rates and how.</p>
<p>In the US, the most important interest rates (called key rates) are the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">federal fund rate</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp">the discount rate</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The federal fund rate is is the amount of interest central private banks charge each-other when lending their excess reserves. This impact all loans across the board as banks will increase their interest rates depending on this one (which impact the cost of credits for the borrower).</li>
<li>The discount rate is the amount of interest central banks charge private banks for short-term loans. When short-term loans can’t borrow money from other private banks, they start to ask their central banks. Acting on it, will either incentivize banks to borrow from the central bank or not. This impact the global money supply on the market as central banks are the only ones creating/destroying money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before enacting any change in key rates or using any of the following tool <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">(called open market operations, OMO)</a>, the FED (and FOMC) analyse the economy and do a speech. In those speeches, they will mention any rate change, open market operations but they will also provide their forecast which investors listen to closely. It is also interesting to listen the next few days to the market reaction, usually, people will start to communicate and what they think about the current situation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-yield-curve-control-4797189">Yield curve control (YCC, continuous control)</a> The FED targets a long term interest rate by buying and/or selling treasury bonds, the number of bonds needed is uncapped, the goal is to control their to keep their yield at the targeted long term interest rate. The central bank will keep buying/selling treasury bonds for any amount of time it feels needed. The treasury-bond is then completely controlled by the central bank.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing (QE, instantaneous injection)</a> The FED buys a massive, but specific, amount of bonds, reducing the supply of those bonds on the bond market, which increase their value and so decrease their yield. This is a good way to reduce yield for Treasury bonds while augmenting the money supply on the market. The goal here is to inject liquidity at a given time, not target a specific interest rate: after the move, the market comes back to its usual dynamic. Also, any kind of bond can be bought by the central bank, it is not targeted at treasury bonds.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money">Helicopter money (people QE, instantaneous injection)</a> What is called helicopter money is just a direct deposit in people bank accounts. It’s a form of quantitative easing but directed at the population directly. It is known to increase demand and inflation more directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Stimulus This is just an umbrella term that is mainly used by the government to package a set of bills together. It can contain any mix of previous tools and tas adjustment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Central banks have other tools but the purpose of this post is not to give a complete overview. The previously cited tools are the ones with the strongest impact on the open market which is our main subject.</p>
<h2 id="open-market-dynamics">Open market dynamics</h2>
<p>Now that we know all the different players in the game, we can start to finally ponder what are the dynamics. We’ll keep our focus on the US market now.</p>
<p>So far we have explored different forces:</p>
<ul>
<li>inflation</li>
<li>expectation especially, expected inflation</li>
<li>supply and demand</li>
<li>tax</li>
<li>risk</li>
</ul>
<p>We have noticed 2 special players: The US government and the FED. And we have an infinite amount of other “normal” investors of all size, period etc.</p>
<h3 id="the-us-market-and-the-other-markets">The US market and the other markets</h3>
<p>The US does not live in a vacuum and its government bonds are not only bought by the American people. Many foreigners have been buying those bonds because the dollar was considered a safe-heaven<!-- TODO: Need more on that --></p>
<p>One actor, in particular, can have a tremendous impact now: China. It happens that China has bought many US treasury bonds. If they decide to sell all of them in a quick timeframe, you can be sure that the bond market will take a decent hit and the FED will not be able to buy enough in the same period to protect the bond market.</p>
<h3 id="flywheels">Flywheels</h3>
<!-- TODO: draw them -->
<p>Instead of spending time writing a paragraph, let me just pus a flywheel to you:</p>
<!-- First case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED follow it -->
<ul>
<li>Inflation rate increase: the price of things increase -&gt; Cost of existing debt decrease (good for the existing borrower) -&gt; Commodities price increase (commodities stocks increase) -&gt; Real estate price increase (real estate stocks increase) -&gt; Companies selling things make more money -&gt; FED decide to increase the federal fund rate and discount rate to follow the inflation rate -&gt; interbank loan rate increase -&gt; everyone loan and credit rate increase -&gt; cost of borrow increase (not good for the new borrower) -&gt; borrowing, in general, slows down -&gt; Companies might not be able to borrow anymore (or issue new bonds) -&gt; zombie companies might struggle to pay back their principals (can’t roll-over existing debt) -&gt; junk-bonds default increase -&gt; Investors try to rotate out of junk bonds before it happens -&gt; other assets value increase -&gt; Growth companies functioning on debt might struggle to borrow -&gt; Rating agency might decrease their grade -&gt; Some companies move from “investment-grade” to “junk” bonds (fallen angel) -&gt; Drastic bond yield increase -&gt; at the beginning (or before) short-term investor rotates out the bond market to avoid bonds price decrease -&gt; other assets value increase -&gt; at the end (when yield stabilize at a new level), short term investors rotate back in to gather high yield bonds -&gt; other assets value decrease -&gt; bonds treasury yield increase -&gt; bonds market decrease and so bond yields increase -&gt; long term investors (pension funds) rotate internally of the bond market to gather those high yields bonds</li>
</ul>
<!-- Second case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED don't follow it [CURRENT SITUATION] -->
<ul>
<li>Inflation rate increase: the price of things increase -&gt; FED does not like it and uses QE to increase the generic bond price and/or YCC to ensure treasury yields are constant and/or keep key rates low -&gt; increase inflation in the open market (month injection) -&gt; The money dump should increase other assets value (including the stock market) -&gt; real treasury yield starts to be negative -&gt; Long term bond investors (pension fund) might not like it and rotate out of the bond market -&gt; A fight between the FED and other bond investors start to kick in (FED wants to keep low yield, bonds investors want to increase yield) -&gt; depending on the winner, more or fewer bond investors rotate in or out (2008 crisis)</li>
</ul>
<!-- Third case: expected inflation rate increase ahead of inflation rate [MIGHT HAPPEN SOON] -->
<ul>
<li><p>Reopening the economy (supply has decrease) + stimulus with direct payment -&gt; governement increase debt -&gt; rating agency could lower the US grade -&gt; treasury yield increase -&gt; Expected inflation rate increase -&gt; Money reach everyone -&gt; spending increase -&gt; demand increase -&gt; inflation increase</p></li>
<li><p>Expected inflation rate increase -&gt; The market might preempt increase in bond yields -&gt; investors rotate out of the bond market -&gt; bond yields increase (self-fulfilling) -&gt; other assets value (including stock market) increase -&gt; FED announce QE or YCC -&gt; reverse the dynamic</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- Fourth case: unexpected hyperinflation -->
<ul>
<li>Hyperinflation happens: drastic price increase -&gt; the open market enters into short-term reactionnary behaviour -&gt; Bond market crash -&gt; Growth stock crash -&gt; Commodities explode</li>

<p>The bias bond market can be very difficult to predict because, in general, the market is not efficient and also because of this bias. The example of the Obama stimulus is a good example. In 2008, post housing crisis, Obama injected 800 Billion into the economy (big at the time). Some were tax cut and some of it was bonds. At the time, people didn’t like deficit and so people were scared that this bonds injection would make the bond market crash. Some big bonds investors bought this theory and sell all their bonds adding to the self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>But in 2009, The FED started to lower the FED rate and buy bonds. This was enough to keep the price up to and yields low but it somehow contradicts supply and demand.</p>
<p>Nowadays people argue that all this is coming from the notion of inflation expectation. If the crowd believe the inflation is low and will stay low, then they accept to keep or even bonds. On the other hand, if they believe inflation will increase or worst, that it’s higher than the official sources. They might sell to pressure the bond market to lower prices and so increase yields.</p>
<p>But remember, The FED could at any time, intervene to maintain yields low. At that point, it starts to become a battle with bond shorted and the FED…</p>

<p>And, as of March 19th, if we look at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm">last 20 years in price change</a> we can see mainly three things: - The average inflation rate is around 2% even though it always fluctuates. - Inflation increased sharply before the housing crisis and sharply decrease during and shortly after. - The COVID, on the other hand, Literally froze prices (the rate went down to 0) and it’s starting to increase again.</p>
<p>So, why do people are talking <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=inflation">about inflation now</a>? Why do we see more information about hyperinflation online?</p>
<p>Exactly because the rate already increased while the economy was shut down and reopening the economy might be the match that can light the hyperinflation rocket.</p>
<p>The second problem is that we are in a casino market and we already see the effect with hedge funds being margin called and their rippled effect onto the banks: - Margin debt is high as f*** - SPACs and NFTs share way too many traits with the internet bubble - Everyone is a genius (people suffers risk-addiction)</p>

<p>I don’t know but whatever you do, keep in mind that risk is all over the market.</p>
<p>On one side you could be bullish: - <a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1370569377284812809">Third stimulus only 3 months after the second</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1377062211634479104">Infrastructure stimulus</a></p>
<p>On the other side, it looks ready to burst: - <a href="https://zensecondlife.blogspot.com/2021/03/a-consensus-of-implosion.html">A consensus of implosion</a></p>
<p>For me, we now are in a landmine growth territory. If you move forward securely, you should be allright for a while but don’t step on a landmine or you lose a leg.</p>

<h3 id="ok-but-where-to-invest">Ok but where to invest?</h3>
<p>First, the global market will probably see a strong correction. If your long, you don’t care as Cathie is explaining here. If you are swinging, might be time to be bearish. If you are intraday, come on, do you even care about macro shift??</p>
<p>Before the correction, I would try to get some bucks and ETF that contains growth stock by shorting them or buying some puts. But we don’t know when it will happen maybe you aim large.</p>
<p>After the correction is done, tear apart ETF in commodities, energy, bank and find value stock. Invest in those.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with complex investment vehicles, you could look into those but in that field, you are on your own.</p>

<p>This is not the time to be leveraged, this is not the time to risk it all! Don’t YOLO now! Don’t be like HWANG!</p>
<p>If you are not shy to get out of the US stock market, you might find good opportunities too. you could potentially buy Chinese bonds for example as it seems we might soon see a <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when">tectonic shift there</a></p>
