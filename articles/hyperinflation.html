<h2 id="hyperinflation-doomsday-and-opportunities">HyperInflation, doomsday and opportunities</h2>
<p>Meh!</p>
<p>A not so quick article about what is coming in the market. It’s going to be quite dense so ake yourself comfortable and enjoy the learn!</p>
<p>Our goal here is to explain in simple words what is inflation, how it impact the stock market and what one can do to protect are even beenfit from it. It is in no way precise nor perfectly accurate. As usual, the devil hide in the details and one should always analyse more precisely the situation before taking actions.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not financial advice but only some educational material for apes.</p>
<h1 id="tldr">TLDR</h1>
<ul>
<li>Inflation is real and observed in many sectors</li>
<li>Reopening the economy might be the match that light the inflation rocket leading to hyperinflation</li>
<li>Interest rates will increase all over the board and loans will get very expensive</li>
<li>The bond market will crash</li>
<li>Growth stocks will suffer</li>
<li>Value and commodities stocks will surge</li>
<li>The FED is uying time with the stimmy and QE</li>
<li>In a very short term, you can grab sone nice juicy percent in the stock market (thanks to stimmy)</li>
<li>In the long term you better bet against ETF bonds, growth stocks et the market in general</li>
<li>But you can’t get out of the market because of hyperinflation</li>
<li>So you better choose wisely your commodities-value stocks!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="demistification">Demistification</h2>
<p>WTF is hyperinflation? Hyperinflation is a sudden change of the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Thanks dummy, WTF is this inflation rate then? Inflation (and deflation) are two words to refer to the rate of change in the price of “things”. Understand “things” as very broadly here: food, energy, house, stocks, bonds, ETF, etc. Anything that is sold.</p>
<p>What people do is that they look at the current price of things now (p_t) then they look at the price of those things 2 month later (p_t+!) and calculate the ratio: <span class="math inline">\(inflation rate = \frac{p_{t+1}}{p_t}\)</span>. If this ratio is &gt; 1 we use the term inflation, if it’s lower, we use the term deflation.</p>
<p>So hyperinflation, is the situation when a sudden and strong change happens. Like you went to buy your baguette yesterday at 1$ and today the baker ask 1.5$ (ho my). In this example the inflation rate would be 50% over one day. (it’s a rate because you need two point in time to get it).</p>
<p>So you can measure the inflation rate of anything but the one that people usually refers to is the inflation rate measured by the Consumer price index (CPI) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index.</p>
<pre><code>I need to look into those  graph more carefully.

You can find the very official source of the CPI here: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/
Since people like to count things, you can find one for multiple things!
- The generic one: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPALTT01USM657N
- The one for people living in cities: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL
- the one for food and beverage in cities: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIFABSL
- the one for rent in cities: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SEHA
etc.</code></pre>
<p>This CPI is important because it’s the one impacting the middle and lower class the most. People actually go outside, look at prices and make those graph. Crazy right? Anyway, this CPI is a concrete measure of how much costs things. For smart people, things are called commodities. It is a measure of the past (smart people use the term lagging measure), not a prediction. It is lagging because it gets updated after the month end and it takes time to count things.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-problem-with-this-hyperinflation-things-though">What the problem with this hyperinflation things though?</h2>
<p>Well, you definitely won’t like if your baguette cost triple when you wake up tomorrow. That’s the simple answer. The more complex one is the one that interests us, investors.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-investors-we">What are investors (we)?</h3>
<ul>
<li>An investor is anyone who is willing to give money to someone in the hope that this someone will give more momey back later. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. Even if you have only 1$, you can be an investor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of investors is to make money, the more they can make the happier they are. The second goal of investors is to minimize risks. They want to make money but they don’t want to take the risk to lose money. And since every investment contains some risk, a good investors is the one balancing risk and reward successfully.</p>
<p>This lead our usual investor to follow those simple rules: - For a fixed risk, one would invest into the opportunity providing more return on investment (ROI) - For a fixed ROI, one would invest in the less risky one.</p>
<p>From a investor point of view, anything can now be compared with those 2 properties: risk and return, we can rename the return as a “rate” as long as we divide by the duration of the investment.</p>
<p>So we now focus on those 2 properties: risk and rate. The goal is to minimize risk while maximising rate i.e. maximising the amount of money you are making in the lowest possible amount of time.</p>
<p>This is how you can compare anything even investors themselves. Sould you invest in stock, bonds, ETF, funds, …? Let’s compare the rate on a given period for those investment!</p>
<p>That said, let me note that the lowest rate you should aim for is not 0% but the inflation rate. If you go under the inflation rate, you effectively lost money during that period</p>
<h3 id="its-all-bout-roi">It’s all bout ROI</h3>
<p>I just want to be clear here, whatever you want to do, you are going to need money. Whatever you want to build, you need to fund yourself and if you don’t have any money, the only way to start funding yourself is either to work or take a loan. Notice though that if you work, you might not have time to start your own project. Now, if you want to take a loan, then, someone has to give you that loan and that someone will look at its potential ROI and risk.</p>
<p>Now if the ROI happens to be 0 or even negative, what does happen? Simple, you can’t take a loan anymore because nobody will provide you a loan anymore.</p>
<h3 id="how-inflation-impact-investors">How inflation impact investors</h3>
<p>The problem with inflation is that nobody likes it. It fou have a 100$ and you just keep them under the pillow. What you could buy with those 100$ might not be accessible anymore next month/quaarter/year.</p>
<p>One way to protect against this loss of money value is to invest into something with a rate above inflation.</p>
<p>To really understand how much the investors make it must look at the difference between ROI and inflation rate ROI - IR. Quite simple so far.</p>
<p>(You might wonder what make prices change and to keep it short there 2 culprits : supply/demand and production cost)</p>
<p>Anyway, as an investor you want ro make profit bigger than the inflation rate on a given time period. This is why a hight inflation rate is not really cool because you need to “beat” the inflation rate.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-bonds">What are bonds?</h2>
<p>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp https://www.thestreet.com/investing/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-bond-market-1087488 https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-yields-and-interest-rate.asp</p>
<p>When you need to make a loan, you usually go see the bank but what if you need more money that one bank can provide? This is when you use bonds. Each bond is a tiny loan, like a tiny contract, containing the following properties: - The original price of the bond (before it reaches the market) - The coupon, this is the fixed income part. - the interval at which the coupon is paid - Finally the date at which the bond mature, meaning at which the full loan will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>the difference with usual loans is that bonds end up on the open market just like stocks. So you can resell your bond to someone else and as usual, the bond price fluctuate because of supply and demand. The trick to understand is that it necessrily impact the yield of that bond.</p>
<p>Inflation rate not only impact how much you pay things, but it also impact the stock market which impaact the bank which imapct for a second time, you.</p>
<p>How is that? It has to do with bonds.</p>
<p>Bonds are loan, but in the stock market. When you buy a bonds, you simply agree on a ROI at a given date. as a simple example the us governement as the FED might issue bonds with the following properties: - cost 100<span class="math inline">\(, ROI 3%, 1year It means that if you buty one bond at 100\)</span> from the FED, you are sure to get back 103$ in one year.</p>
<p>Those bonds from the FED are special because they are what we call “risk free”. Unless the USA disappears, you will indeed get your 103$ in one year. And because those are risk free, any other risk-free investment will have to match that rate because if not, investors will just move their money away from less interesting bonds.</p>
<p>To make that more official, the FED actually defines every two month the FED target interest rate. This is the rate at which following bonds will be issued. It is a “target” because it is not enforced by the govrnement but supply/demand and the market should quickly react to match it usually.</p>
<p>This rate actually impact you, because it impacts how all loans rate in the US computed. Even those small loans on your credit card.</p>
<p>FED rate -&gt; bonds rate -&gt; bank rate. If that rate is high, you might be tempted as an investors to invest into this risk free product: you might rotate your investment from stocks to bonds -&gt; stocks go down.</p>
<p>But if IR is upper that the target rate, then the opposite will happens, investors will move away from bonds and go into something else like stocks.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-control-inflation">How to control inflation?</h3>
<p>The FED as multiple tools to do so and it is all about debt</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yield curve control (continuous control) The FED targets a long term interest rate by buying and/or selling bonds, the number of bonds needed is unccaped, the goal is to keep their price at a given target to have their interest rate at the long term interest rate. It will keep buying/selling to maintains bonds interest rate at that given target for a “long time”. The bond market is then completely controled by the FED https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-yield-curve-control-4797189</p></li>
<li><p>Quantitative easing (instantaneous injection) The FED buys a massive, but specific, amount of bonds, reducing the supply of those bonds on the bond market, which increase their value and so decrease their interest rate. At the same time, the amount of money on market increase which makes it more liquid. The goal here is to inject liquidity at a given time, not target a specific interest rate: after the move, the market come back to its usual dynamic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing</p></li>
<li><p>Interest on excessive reserves (defined by the FOMC, subgroup of the FED) which gives an incentives to bank to keep an excess reserve (pulling money off the economy)</p></li>

<p>The bullish case of the third stimulus: https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1370569377284812809</p>
<p>Buuuuuuuutttt</p>
<p>this is short term, because of direct payment, we have CPI inflation coming at the door, rates will increase and so stock will fall.</p>
<p>My anti-bet is on the current bubble which for me are SPACs. Those not yet making money won’t be able to re-finance themselves and it will probably mean death.</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>
<h3 id="growth-stocks-versus-value-stock">Growth stocks versus value stock</h3>
<p>https://www.merrilledge.com/article/growth-vs-value-investing-two-approaches-to-stocks</p>
<p>To keep it simple: - Growth stocks take loans to finance their growth (in the bond market) - Value stock on the other hand are undervalue assets. Both have a high potential for 2 different reason but one will suffer if rates hike: growth stocks.</p>
<p>Why? Because</p>
<h3 id="commodities-stock">Commodities stock</h3>
<p>If you are not living in a bubble, commodities stocks are presented as no brainers nowadays. I have to agree especially if they are currently undervalued (and so a value stock)</p>
<h3 id="anything-else">Anything else?</h3>
<p>If you scared, you should go into gold or something like, by definition, it should match “real rate” which should be &gt;= inflation rate.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Find value stocks in commodities and short bonds. Secure yourself into metals, gold, uranium, whatever. Short the current bubble: SPACs (which is the new tech bubble for sure)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
