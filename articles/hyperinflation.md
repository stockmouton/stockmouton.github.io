- Investors are investors: they maximise ROI. The goal is to not lose money for sure, but they ask for more: Not lose purchasing power or even better: winning money and increasing purchasin power and welath
- Inflation is what threaten the investor, it's the pressure that keeps investors on the look out.
- The goal of investors: ROI > inflation rate over a fixed period of time.
- What is inflation? What is hyperinflation?
- To avoid losing power, investors can look into different kind of investment opportunities
- Let's limit ourselves to bonds and stocks
- What are stocks? (high risk, high return, you might loose money)
- What are bonds? (low risk, quite deterministic, defined interest rate associated) description of the bond market with yield explication
- so bonds yield > inflation rate to be interesting.
- What would be the impact of hyperinflation?
- Surprise and strong inflation would make investors stop investing into bonds with lower yield than the inflation. (they might invest  in rsiker bonds, in stocks or other bond market, not US)
- Supply/demand will lower bonds price, increasing their yield
- The dynamic will settle to a new yield level.
- At that point, companies that need investment for growth might not want to borrow money at high interest rate. (growth stocks will suffer)
- Existing companies having dynamic interet rates might be in trouble and die
- Rating agencies might downgrade many companies increasing even more the struggle
- You might start to see bonds default
- Those companies stocks will plummet or even die. It will be landmine for stock investors. Because of that people might invest elsewhere in general for a while. leading to a new market crash.
- Remember moneys flow between countries, investment vehicules, cryptocurrencies etc.

- So you definitely don't want hyperinflation. How can we keep it under control?
- GOV -> economic growth (growth > inflation: nobody cares about inflation, plenty of interesting investment opportunities)
- FED -> control FED rate (the mother of all interest rates)

- The GOV can: borrow money at low rate all the time (risk-free debt) and cut taxes to lower cost of production
- The FED can: buy/sell bonds to control US bond market yield level, FIX the FED rate, implement divers policies to keep rate lows.
BUT
- The utimate indicator if the inflation rate: creating debt or injecting money into the economy has some drawbacks.
- As a country you have to compete with therest of the world in respect to investment opportunities.

- All right, but what could actually start a hyperinflation? Reopening economy with low supply and slow growth + helicopter money.

To recap:
- inflation rate < bond yield
- inflation rate up -> bond yield up -> bond price down -> investment rotate to bond market after the crash -> stock down (not all, companies selling stuff at higher price and banks at highier loan yield will make more money -> value stocks and good banks up)
- inflation rate low or down -> bond yield can be low -> investment rotate to other possibilities like stock -> stock up (also companies can borrow cheaply -> growth stocks up)
- inflation rate low, no need for high economic growth, no need for high debt, yout country stays good for investmnent

Ok, so what to look for?
- inflation rate
- 3y/10y/30y Treasury yields (the market pricing in expected inflation rate)
- Listen to the FED + FED target rate and open market operations
- Listen to the gov and tax cuts/debt
- signals of economic growth: unemployment level, GDP,
- population sentiment about inflation
- bubbles, casino behaviours (look at margin debt, )
- Value stocks/ growth stocks and subsequent ETF.
- money pairs
- Other part of the worlds that compete with your country. For US, china has to be look for.

I would already secure myself against a crash
 -->

<!-- # OLD TL;DR
- Inflation is real and observed in many sectors (housing, energy)
- The US Governement can hide it, because it can manipulate the CPI and this is what it usually refers to in public discourse.
- The FED maintains a low FED rate but it might have to announce that it will increase its long term target rate in comming years.
- Reopening the economy might will increase the inflation rate and could be the match that light the inflation rocket leading to hyperinflation
- Interest rates will increase all over the board and loans in general will get very expensive
- Those doomsday predictions might lead to some real inflation expectation which would lead to the bond market crash
- Growth stocks will suffer and "zombie" companies will die
- Value and commodities stocks will surge (after a global and quick market correction)
- The FED is buying time with the stimmy and QE
- In a very short term, you can grab some nice juicy percent in the stock market thanks to stimmy
- It might be a good time to assure yourself against sudden corrections
- Remember, you can't be out of the market because of hyperinflation if you don't want to loose buying power
- So you better pick wisely your commodities-value stocks for some nice growth!
- And short some wisely picked ETF and complex financial instrument to profit the those corrections just in case. -->

# HyperInflation, doomsday and opportunities: A primer
Meh!

I've been lurking in reddit `r/options` lately and I stumbled upon this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m4ffmx/long_commodities_short_bonds_protection_against/) predicting doomsday, hyperinflation, the crash of the bond market and subsequently, the stock market.

I don't know if the hypotheses holds or not. On the other hand, being a little bit more educational about the underlying dynamics that would trigger this doomsday crash felt needed. So, I decided to expore the subject and write a quick recap about this hyperinflation thing and why it matters.

It is in no way state-of-the-art thinking nor perfectly accurate. The devil hide in the details and this is not the aim of this post. Remember to do your own DD, apply what you learn, make your own prediction, observe what happens, learn from your mistakes and repeat!

Also, I'm quite new to the finance subject overall so take this post as a primer.

> Obviously, this is not financial advice but only some educational material for apes.

## TLDR
<!-- TODO -->

## A quick overview of the game
Before diving into what is inflation and how it impacts investors, let's look at the game itself.

We are playing the investment game. In this game you have investors on one side and assets on the other. Investors try to make money by investing into those assets and assets try to attract investors money to grow. This game is played all around the world, 24h/7: it's a global economic competition and collaboration system.

### investors
Investors plan is simple:

- Invest money in assets
- Wait
- Profit (get back more money)

The difficult part is in "picking the right asset". Investors have a nearly infinite amout of possible investments in this world: Housing, startup, stock, bonds, derivatives, art, etc. And, access to all the investment all around the world is at the tip of their fingers in real-time.

So, anyone can be an investor. Al you need is the will to follow the simple plan. The good news is that you can be any kind of investors by controlling any of those 3 phases:

- The amount of your investment (from $0.01 to $1 Trillion).
- The amount of time you are ready to let money in the asset (from 1 millisecond to a century).
- The amount of risk you are ready to take (from risk-free assets to lottery ones).

<!-- TODO: I don't like this part -->
As an investors all we have is our strategy and our model of the world. It's a tough game because we can loose it all and, by the end of the day, we still need to live in the real world which has a cost: the amount of money we need to maintain our way of life. If we go as far as wanting to live from it or even better increase our wealth, the pressure to perform in this game starts to be aggressive.

We can measure our success with some simple math. As a rough first estimate, we can look at our return on investment (ROI):

$$ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Final value of the investment} - \text{Cost of the investment}}{\text{Cost of the investment}} $$

Our goal: maximise the ROI.

#### Multiple kinds of investors
<!-- TODO: Whale, pension funds, retail investors. Some notions like window dressing, rotations etd.  -->

### Assets
On the other side, assets try to attract investors money. The need to satisfy any kind of investors spurs into reality any kind of assets: secure, risky, volatile, constant, expensive, cheap, etc. Any opportunity void will soon be filled.

To attract investors, assets are designed to make a promise of a nice return to investors. Sometimes, the promise is strongly grounded into financial mechanics, sometimes it's just a pure promise, no ties atttached.

Their prices in the open market is mainly driven by supply and demand. But it'a not the only force that influence the market, an other important one is inflation.

## What is inflation?
Inflation (and deflation) are words which refer to the rate of change in the price of "things". Understand "things" as very broadly here: food, energy, house, stocks, bonds, ETF, etc. Anything that has a price.

To get the inflation rate:

- you look at the current price of things now: $p_t$.
- You wait some time $\Delta t$.
- You look again at those same prices $p_{t + \Delta t}$ and you calculate the ratio:

$$\text{inflation rate} = R_{inf} = \frac{p_{t + \Delta t}}{p_t}$$

- If you have $R_{inf} \gt 1$ we use the term inflation.
- If you have $R_{inf} \lt 1$, we use the term deflation.

Nothing more, nothing less.

> *Sidenote: notice how it is similar to the investor simple plan*

The inflation rate can be measured for anything and people indeed measure the inflatin of everything. One inflation rate attract more attention than the others: the inflation rate measured by the Consumer price index (CPI) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index. And people tend to focus on it because it is supposed to represent the cost of life for lower and middle class (can be debated).

The problem is that this index is an average of many part and the government can influence some of them quite directly which could hide actual inflation.

Inflation is something that should be happening but at a moderate rate. As long as inflation fluctuates slowly, the economy can adapt smoothly and it should be fine. Problems arise when quick change happens (like hyperinflation or hyperdeflation). Near-zero inflation or deflation is considered harmfull too but for ther reasons (signs of bad economy).

### Impact on investors
Inflation impact directly investors because if things starts to be more expensive, they need to earn even more money to keep what we call their "purchasing power". The purchasing power is litteraly the power to buy things. If a $100 this year allows you to buy less things than a $100 5 years ago, then you lost some purchasing power. Since inflation rate measure how prices change, it becomes the direct measure of how much investors need to grow their amount of money to keep their purchasing power:

$$ \text{ROI} > \text{inflation rate} $$

When people take into account inflation to compute numbers, they add the word "real". For example the real ROI is:

$$ \text{real ROI} = \text{ROI} - \text{inflation rate}$$

*sidenote: The actual investors benefit per year must be computed by taking into account other costs like taxes and the cost of life during that year*

On a given period of the past, it is easy to compute the real ROI. But things start to be more complicated when we talk about the future. If you want to anticipate what will be your real ROI you now have two numbers to guess: your expected ROI and the expected inflation during that same period.

In this predictions realm, people like to confirm their bias (psychological trait shared by the human specie) so be wary of any humans being too sure about its own prediction. It's even harder as the open amrket is considered [a second order chaotic system](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/first-second-order-chaos/) and by definition is unpredictable.

So we are stuck with statistics (oriented in the past), gut feeling, beliefs, reactory behaviours, etc. But those beliefs, when shared by many are a strong force that also impact the open market because they create expectations. We don't know how many people that share an expectation is needed to influence the market but when it happens, the expectatin becomes a self-fuffiling prophecy: If enough people wants an asset to go up or down, it might very well happen.

Why I'm talking about that? Because expected inflation in particular is a very powerful force in the market and especially in the bond market.

We are going to dive into the basics of the bond and stock market to understand how those forces interacts with each other. we leave out derivatives (options, futures, etc.) and any other markets to keep it simple but we keep looking at the world markets.

## Bonds and Stocks
Bonds and stocks represent two very different way to invest. Bonds are loans and stocks are pure investment. The main difference is that for bonds, you have a contract dictating how much return you will make when you buy it, and for stocks, you are mainly buying a promise that the company will grow and make more money.

### Stocks
When you invest into stocks, you buy shares. It means you own a part of the company. The overall value of the company is represented by those share price and the amount of them. If the company makes a profit, it's good to have those shares because you will be paid some money owning them(dividend). Those shares will also become more attractive and by the supply/demand effect, the share price will increase.

Those dividends are not certain, you might get any for many years (apple, amazon, etc.) but if the company is still growing anyway. You might not care as your goal could be to sell the shares you bought a low price, at high price.

Attractiveness of stocks drives supply/demands and they all compete for investors money. Investors have to make their own mind about how a stock is attractive or not and this point of view can widly differ.

#### Growth stocks versus value stock
To keep it simple:

- Growth stocks take loans to finance their growth (in the bond market)
- Value stock on the other hand are undervalue assets.

Both have a high potential for 2 different reason but one will suffer if rates hike: growth stocks.

### Bonds
When you invest in bonds, things are very different.

First, bonds can not only be issued from corporations but also from municipals, states and governements.
Second, a bond is issued with the following properties:

- Face value: the price at which the bond is issued
- The coupon rate (interest rate): Percentage per year of the face value paid to the bond holder. Can be fixed or variable.
- Maturity date: the date at which the amount of borrowed money (Call the principal = the face value) is given back to the bond holder.

Bonds are interesting because they lower the risk of losing money.The usual flow for bonds is as follow:

- You pay the face value to buy the bonds when they are issued
- You receive a fixed-income equal to the coupon rate every year.
- You get back your money at mthe maturity date.

Good, it reduces uncertainty but in exchange, bonds provide less potential ROI than stocks.

Since bonds are predictable, you can easily compare them with the current economic situation. To be attractive, the coupon rate must be important enough relative to teh economic situation and in particular, the inflation rate. But since bonds have a maturity date that can go be very long, people are way of inflation variation in the future. This is why the expected inflation rate matters some much.

Investors won't buy bonds if they think their interest rate is lower than what they expect inflation to be over the bonds validity period.

On the other side, the one issuing bonds is borrowing money and would rather borrow at low interest. Those opposite incentives control supply and demands in the bond market.

#### What happens after bonds are issued?
The story does not stop here. If you buy a bond when it is issued, you are not stuck with it until the maturity date. The bond market is here so you can trade bonds after. At that point, bonds are competing with other bonds and more generally with other assets.

Even though the face value of the bond has been fixed when it was emitted, it's current price can fluctuate. This leads to a new notion: the yield.

The yield isSince the coupon's value has been calculated relatively to the face value of the bond. This one is fixed though time. The bond yield is the dynamic interest rate and is calculated like that:

$$ yield = \frac{\text{annual coupon payment}}{\text{current bond price}}$$

As a quick example, a bond with a face value of $1000 with a fixed interest rate of 5% lead to a total coupon of  50$ per year. if the price of the bonds decrease to 900$ the yield is now $\frac{50}{900} = 0.55 = 55%$
The yield is by definition, inversely linked to the bond price: the the yield increase, the bond price decrease and vice-versa.

Bonds yields are a good measure for investors because you can compare it directly to the inflation rate or your expected inflation rate for the period of time you want to hold onto it. Outside of special circumstance or external intervention bonds price should move as to satisify the following:

$$ \text{yield} > \text{inflation rate} \Rightarrow \text{current price} < \frac{\text{coupon's value}}{\text{inflation rate}}$$

#### How to perceive bonds risk?
So far we observed only one risk on bond price: the evolution of the inflation rate.

But there is a second one: the risk that the borrower do not return the money at the maturity date or even can't pay the interest. We say that the bond default.
It's rare to see a bond default before maturity date, because the coupon's value should not be very high. At maturity, the total principal is huge if they borrower as not grow enough, it might in trouble to reimburse the full amount.
In most case, and when the economy is all right, the borrower will just restructure, or issue new bonds and everything is fine. But the risk still exists.

To mitigate that risk, people came together ans created rating agencies. Their goal is to rate bonds on their default risk. There is quite a lot of different grades and those grades are different between agencies but ultimately, the result is that bonds end up to be either "investment grade" or "junk bonds".

The distinction has a big impact on bonds price because naturally, investors will want higher interest rate for higher risk. If a company starts to struggle financially, it's bond might be downgraded by rating agencies and if they happen to fall under the junk bonds umbrella, the market will react by asking a higher yield and so, the bond price will fall.
This is especially bad for those so-called zombies company. Zombies company are the one that survive only thanks to their debt and make barely enough money to reimburse the coupon. Those companies are in real trouble if rates increase and so are very risky.

### The link between the bond and stock market
Those 2 markets compete with each others to provide interesting assets to investors.

<!--
TODO: Investment rotations between the 2 markets
-->

## Hyperinflation

Hyperinflation is a sudden and strong inflation rate increase. Concretely, if it happens in 24h and it amount to 50%, it would mean that the  baguette you were buying at 1$ so far, cost now 1.5$! It would be quite f**ed up.
It's never that quick but even if it takes a year it would be extrememly difficult for many people to keep a decent life.

### Impact on the open market
As we've already seen, bonds yield (or interest rate at issuance) must be higher than inflation to attract investors. But if the inflation rate increase rapidly, what you quickly see will be a demand for higher yields bonds and so existing bonds price will crash and stabilize at a new equilibrium satysfying the new demand for higher yields.

But the impact does not stop here.

First, investors that have high inflation expectation will start to sell bonds before the price decrease adding more fuel to fire.
Second, companies that need to borrow money might not be able to do so because interest rates for new bonds must be high too which means that you will have to pay an expensive price regularly for your debt.
Third, existing companies that have variable interest rate might suffer directly because they might have to pay more per year.
Fourth, existing companies that already borrow money using bonds and are getting closer to their maturity date might not be able to reimburse. When interet rates satys the same though a long period of time, it is no problem as the company will issue new bonds, to reimburse the principals of the old one. But now that interest rised greatly, it might be impossible for it and they might default their bonds.

All those effects increae risk in the bond market, and investors will ask for even higher yields.

And it doesn't stop here because after the bond market crash, now investors can find high yields in the bond market. And investors will start to rotate from other assets to bonds. This usually have a big impact on the stock market as a lot of money will come from it and so you should see some part of the stock market to crash. Especially bubbles.

*Sidenote: usually the bond market crash and stock market are synchronised because the open market is full of robot and reactionnary investors.*

Remember that we are only looking at investors point of view, but actually this will be very bad for the economy overall. Investment will slow down, economic growth will not recover directly you end up in a recession period which is a correction for the real economy.
I'm not even talking about the struggles the lower class would face abd the fact that you might want to increase minimum wage which would increase demands and potentially increae even more the inflation rate. There are lots of twisted feedback loops regarding inflation.

For the economy and the market, the goal is to get back to a new equilibrium quickly, or even better, if we have to go down at least control this downward movement to avoid drastic changes in people life.

### Why price of things change by the way?
To understand why reopening economy can propulse inflation rate higher, one must understand why things cost what they cost.

To make that simple, there a 3 forces basically:

- Supply and demand
- Cost of production
- Risk of buying/selling

We'll look more into cost of production and risk later. But one won't be surprised to learn that with a slow economy, demand in general has fallen down (yes, some fields have seen a surge, like tech, but the general direction is a lower demand). In reaction, industries lowered their supply accordingly.
When you reopen your economy and consumption starts again, The supply needs to be ramped up and people will probably be quite excited to consume again. Which could create a natural inflation.
It will increase demands with a low supply, it will increse the inflation rate.

Cost of production contains three major part: cost of raw material (important cost), labor cost, financial cost (loan interest rate)
Flywheel: reopening -> increase demand -> increase inflation rate -> increase rates -> increase cost of productions -> increase inflation
                                                                  -> increase bond yeild -> decrease bonds prices

> Note:
The FOMC Meeting on March 17th validated this point. As they said, they expect a "transient inflation rate above 2% in the coming months". Meaning they expect to see a rise of the inflation rate, but it will be temproray and stay under control.

### The bubble case
Bubbles appears because the expectation force becomes predominant. Hijacking human brain, expectation transform itself in self-fulfilling prophecy on a given industry and all the prices sart to increase. Using humans natural fears of FOMO (fear of missing out), people are pilling up and the price keeps going up, validating thesis of first comer which tend to become guru on the fly, arguing that it will keep going up, bringing even more people on the board.

Nowadays, it's even worse as mechanics like short squeeze and so called gamma squeeze come to the party to increase volatility even more. Until the ponzi scheme dries up.

Rarely, people note that a bubble is hyperinflation targeted at an asset or a set of assets. It creates a lot volatily, increase risk drastically. The usual dynamic of hyperinflation is a price overshoot and a settlement in-between the top price and the original price.

Bubbles tend to happens more when the market tends to a casino. A market tend to a casino when volatility increase overall, margin debt increase fast and you start to see a clear trend. ~Looking at you SPACs~

## Governement and central banks

Amoung all the player that are on the open markets, t20 kinds are very special: governments and central banks. Those player are specials because they have special skills that other investors do not have.

### Governements
Governments are elected by the people and their jobs is to help the country improve the average happiness of its people at any timescale. In our dominant belief system, economic growth seems to be the mother of all indicators. Even though I don't believe its true, let's keep things simple by saying the the government jo is to ensure a booming global economy for its country.

To do so, governements have a set of tools to improve its people life (outside of going to wars and use brute force on others in general):

- Tax. By increasing/reducing taxes in different sectors they direclty impact the cost of things of those sectors. This is a good way to control sme part of the inflation rate.
- Debt. Because they can tax people forever (unless the country itself fails), governments can borrow a lot of money on the open market. Government can issue bonds that are "investment grades" by default and considered "risk-free" as it will always pay its interest and the principals at the maturity date. Notice here that governments debt is due to the market which are private entities.
- Laws and Bills. Using the first 2, governements control a gigantic amount of money that they can redirect at different places in the economy. They usually are the only ones that can start tremendus investment which benefit society at large. They could also ban things, you might not know about it but [gold has already been completely comtrolled by the US at some point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act). They might decide to take control over other assets in the future...

Governements impact the bond market because of their treasury bonds. Since those are risk-free, it gives a threshold to the market of what a "risk-free" interest rate is. As long as that rate stays above the inflation rate, those bonds are very interesting for investors seeking very low risk on long period.

### Central banks
Central banks is the second pillar of today economy. While governements can generate debt as much as they want, central banks can do better by creating money as much as they want. Of course it has a broader impact.

Before we dive on the actuals tools of the FED to control the overall economy, think about it twice. At any point in time, if needed, there is an institution that can buy as much things as it wants magically. Litteraly by adding a line in a software somewhere.
Obviously, central banks don't want to distort the open market too much. This is why they only directly impact the bond market and especially treasury bonds.

But they still have tremendous power on the market dynamics. You better hope that their interest is aligned with yours because if the guys in charge believe they have to do something, then they will. This is why central banks statement are closely monitored and you don't want to be on the way of this 100pound gorilla, do you?

#### Central banks tooling
How central banks actually print money? In the pase, they atually printed money for real but nowadays, it's mainly done through the banking system and the open market.
Outside of directly controlling the money supply, cental banks can also change the current economic incentives. They do so by setting interest rates that impact the whole economy. And again, they can officialy or not do so. Let's see what are those interest rates and how.

In the US, the most important interest rates (called key rates) are the [federal fund rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) and [the discount rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp):

- The federal fund rate is is the amount of interest central private banks charge each-other when lending their excess reserves. This impact all loans across the board as banks will increase their interest rates depending on this one (which impact the cost of credits for borrower).
- The discount rate is the amount of interest central banks charge private banks for short-term loans. When short-term loans can't borrow money from other private banks, they start to ask their central banks. Acting on it, will either incentivize banks to borrow from the central bank or not. This impact the global money supply on the market as central banks are the only creting/destroying money.

Before enacting any change in key rates or using any of the following tool [(called open market operations, OMO)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the FED (and FOMC) analyse the  eonomy and do a speech. In those speech, they will mention any rate change, open market operations but they will also provide their forecasr which investors listen closely.
It is also interesting to listen the next few days on the market reaction, usually people will start to communicate and what they think about hte current situation.

The FED targets a long term interest rate by buying and/or selling treasury bonds, the number of bonds needed is unccaped, the goal is to control their to keep their yield at the targeted long term interest rate. The central bank will keep buying/selling treasury bonds for any amount if time it fells needed. The treasury-bond is then completely controled by the central bank.

- [Quantitative Easing  (QE, instantaneous injection)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing)
The FED buys a massive, but specific, amount of bonds, reducing the supply of those bonds on the bond market, which increase their value and so decrease their yield. This is a good way to reduce yield for treasury bonds while augmenting the money supply on the market. The goal here is to inject liquidity at a given time, not target a specific interest rate: after the move, the market come back to its usual dynamic. Also, any kind of bond can be bought by the central bank, it is not targeted at treasury bonds.

- [Helicopter money (people QE, instantaneous injection)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money)
What is called helicopter money is jsut a direct deposit in people bank accounts. It's a form of quantitative easing but directed at the population directly. It is known to increase demand and inflation more directly.

- Stimulus
This is just an umbrella term that is mainly used by the governement to package a set of bills together. It can contains any mix of preivous tools and tas adjustment.

Central banks have other tools but the prupose of this post is to not to give a complete overview. The previously cited tools are the one with the strongest impact on the open market which is our main subject.


## Open market dynamics

Now that we know all the different players in the game, we can start to finaly ponders what are the dynamics. We'll keep our focus on the US market now.

So far we have explored different forces:

- inflation
- expectation especially, expected inflation
- supply and demand
- tax
- risk

We have notice 2 special players: The US government and the FED. And we have an infinite amount of other "normal" investors of all size, time period etc.

### The US market and the other markets
US does not live in a vaccuum and its governement bonds are not only bought by american people. ACtually many foreigners have been buying those bonds because the dollar was considered a safe-heaven<!-- TODO: Need more on that -->

One actor in particular can have a tremendous impact now: China. It happens that china has bought many US treasury bonds. If they decide to sell all of them in a quick timeframe, you can be sure that the bond market will take a decent hit and the FED will not be able to buy enough in the same period of time to protect hte bond market.

### Flywheels
<!-- TODO: draw them -->
Instead of spending time  writing a paragraph, let me just pus a flywheel to you:

<!-- First case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED follow it -->
- Inflation rate increase: price of things increase
    -> Cost of existing debt decrease (good for existing borrower)
    -> Comodities price increase (commodities stocks increase)
    -> Real estate price increase (real estate stocks increase)
    -> Companies selling things make more money
    -> FED decide to increase federal fund rate and discount rate to follow the inflation rate
        -> interbank loan rate increase
            -> everyone loan and credit rate increase
                -> cost of borrow increase (not good for new borrower)
                    -> borrowing in general slows down
                    -> Companies might not be able to borrow anymore (or issue new bonds)
                        -> zombie companies might struggle to pay back their principals (can't roll-over existing debt)
                            -> junk-bonds default increase
                                -> Investors try to rotate out of junk bonds before it happens
                                    -> other assets value increase
                    -> Growth companies functionning on debt might struggle to borrow
                        -> Rating agency might decrease their grade
                            -> Some companies moves from "investment-grade" to "junk" bonds (fallen angel)
                                -> Drastic bond yield increase
                                    -> at the beginning (or before) short-term investor rotates out the bond market to avoid bonds price decrease
                                        -> other assets value increase
                                    -> at the end (when yield stabilize at a new level), short term investors rotate back in to gather high yield bonds
                                        -> other assets value decrease
                    -> bonds treasury yield increase
                        -> bonds market decrease and so bond yields increase
                            -> long term investors (pension funds) rotate internally of the bond market gather those high yields bonds

<!-- Second case: inflation rate increase slowly and FED don't follow it [CURRENT SITUATION] -->
- Inflation rate increase: price of things increase
    -> FED do not like it and use QE to increase generic bond price and/or YCC to ensure treasury yields are constant and/or keep key rates low
        -> increase inflation in the open market (moneh injection)
            -> The money dump should increase other assets value (including the stock market)
        -> real treasury yield starts to be negative
            -> Long term bond investors (pension fund) might not like it and rotate out of the bond market
                -> A fight between the FED and other bond investors start to kick in (FED wants to keep low yield, bonds investors wnat to increase yield)
                    -> depending on the winner, more or less bond investors rotate in or out (2008 crisis)

<!-- Third case: expected inflation rate increase ahead of inflation rate [MIGHT HAPPEN SOON] -->
- Reopening the economy (supply has decrease) + stimulus with direct payment
    -> governement increase debt
        -> rating agency could lower the US grade
            -> treasury yield increase
    -> Expected inflation rate increase
    -> Money reach everyone
        -> spending increase
            -> demand increase
                -> inflation increase

- Expected inflation rate increase
    -> The market might preempt increase in bond yields
        -> investors rotate out of the bond market
            -> bond yields increase (self-fulfilling)
                -> other assets value (including stock market) increase
                    -> FED announce QE or YCC
                        -> reverse the dynamic

<!-- Fourth case: unexpected hyperinflation -->
- Hyperinflation happens: drastic price increase
    -> the open market enters into short-term reactionnary behaviour
        -> Bond market crash
        -> Growth stock crash
        -> Commodities explode

#### Controlling where inflation hits
Those 2 100pounds gorilla can control where inflation happens. By playing with tax, and money injection you might avoid that the price of the CPI increase.
<!-- TODO: Need more on that -->

Beause if global IR increase -> people in general get poorer

Instead, with QE or YCC, money is only injected in the market -> you dodge increase for foods and other real life cost, but now rich get richer and inequalities increase, and that might be worse...

Dollar itself is a thing and supply/demands can be applied to it in comparaison with other currencies. If you increase the quantity of dollars, it should be less valuable as it should be easier to get some.
The quantity of money is tracked by those M* indicators:
M1 money stock: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp
M2 money stock: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp

## Let's see those market dynamic in action

### The gold control
<!-- TODO -->

> Do the work:

> - [Gold Rserver Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act)

### The Obama stimulus and 2008-2009 bond case
The bias bond market can be very difficult to predict because, in general, market are not efficient and also because of thos bias. The example of the Obama stimulus is a good example.
In 2008, post housing crisis, Obama injected 800 Billions into the economy (big at the time). Some were tax cut and some of it were bonds. At the time, people didn't really like deficit and so people were scared tht this bonds injection would actually make the bond market crash. Some big bonds investors bought this theory and sell all their bonds adding to the self-fulfilling prophetie.

But in 2009, The FED started to lower the FED rate and buy bonds. This was enough to keep price up and yields low but it somehow contradict supply and demand.

Nowadays people argue that all this is coming from the notion inflation expectation. IT the  crowd believe the inflation is low and will stay low, then they accept to keep or even bonds. On the other hand if they believe inflation will increase or worst, that it's actually higher than the official sources. They might sell to pressure the bond market to lowerprice and so increase yields.

But remember, The FED could at any time, interven to maintain yields low. At that point it starts to become a battle with bond shorted and the FED...

### The 2019 repo crisis case

## Why are we talking about it now?
Ans, as of March 19th, if we look at [last 20 years in price change](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) we can see mainly three things:
- The average inflation rate is around 2% event though it always fluctuates.
- The inflation increased sharply before the housing crisis and sharply decrease during and shortly after.
- The COVID, on the other hand, Literraly froze prices (the rate went down to 0) and it's starting to increase again.

So, why do people are talking [about of inflation now](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=inflation)? Why do we see more information about hyperinflation online?

Exactly because the rate already increased while the economy was shut down and reopening economy might be the match that can light the hyperinflation rocket.

The second problem is that we are in a casino market and we already see the effect with hedge funds being margin called and their rippled effect onto the banks:
- Margin debt is high as f***
- SPACs share way too much traits with the internet bubble
- Everyone is a genius


### What should we do?

The bullish case of the third stimulus: https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1370569377284812809

Buuuuuuuutttt

this is short term, because of direct payment, we have CPI inflation coming at the door, rates will increase and so stock will fall.

My anti-bet is on the current bubble which for me are SPACs. Those not yet making money won't be able to re-finance themselves and it will probably mean death.

### Ok but where to invest?
First, the global market will probably see a strong correction. If your long, you don't care as Cathie is explainning here. If you are swinging, might be time to be bearish. If you are intraday, come on, do you even care about macro shift??

Before the correction i would try to get some bucks and ETF that contains growth stock bys horting them or buying some puts. But we don't know when it will happen maybe you aim large.

After the correction is done, tear apart ETF in commodities, energy, bank and find value stock. Invest in those.

If you are familiar with complex investment vehicles, you could look into those but on that field, you are on your own.

## Anything else?
This is not the time to be leveraged, this is not the time to risk it all! Don't YOLO now! Don't be like HWANG!

If you are not shy to get out of the US stock market, you might find good opportunities too. you could potentially buy chinese bonds for example as it seems we might soon see a [tectonic shift there](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when)
